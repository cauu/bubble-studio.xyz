## Weekly Summary

This week we achieved a key milestone with the completion of the backend MVP version. All core business capabilities are now in place, including: Cardano wallet login, governance information indexing and publishing, multi-channel news content aggregation, and basic community interaction features.

---

## Core Capabilities Introduction

### 1. Cardano Wallet Login

Users can log into the Bubble platform directly with their Cardano wallet in one click, without any tedious registration process. The system automatically identifies users' on-chain identities, and if a user is a DRep (community representative), the system will automatically associate their representative identity, allowing them to participate in discussions with their real governance role.

### 2. Proposal Module

**Proposal Information Display**  
Automatically syncs all on-chain governance proposals, including proposal titles, summaries, motivation statements, and other core content, allowing users to stay updated on the latest governance developments without jumping between multiple platforms.

**Proposal Voting Record Index**  
Completely records the on-chain voting status of each proposal, including which DReps voted for, against, or abstained, making the voting process more transparent.

**Aggregated Proposal Discussions from Social Platforms**  
Automatically collects X (Twitter) platform discussions related to proposals, helping users quickly understand the community's real opinions and sentiment trends on proposals.

**Off-chain Proposal Evaluation System**  
Users can express their attitude toward proposals (support/oppose/neutral) and post comments to participate in discussions. This off-chain interaction data complements on-chain voting to form a more complete picture of community voice.

---

### 3. DRep (Community Representative) Module

**DRep Basic Information Display**  
Displays basic information for each community representative, including self-introduction, governance philosophy, and goal commitments, helping ordinary users better understand and choose representatives they trust.

**DRep Voting Record Summary**  
Summarizes each DRep's voting history across various proposals, making delegated voting more transparent. Users can evaluate whether representatives have fulfilled their commitments based on this data.

**Aggregated DRep Content from X Platform**  
Automatically associates DReps' X (Twitter) accounts and aggregates their governance-related opinions and discussions, allowing users to more comprehensively understand representatives' daily positions.

**DRep Evaluation**  
Users can rate and provide feedback on DReps, offering reference for the community when choosing representatives.

---

### 4. Information Aggregation

**Cardano Dev Updates Aggregation**  
Automatically syncs official Cardano development progress updates, keeping community users informed about the project's technical development without following multiple information sources.

**Cardano Social Platform (X) Information Aggregation**  
Aggregates discussions about Cardano governance on the X platform, including KOL opinions, hot community topics, and more, creating a one-stop governance information center.

## Next Version Goals

Development of the frontend MVP version and deployment of the frontend-backend system. Users will then be able to officially experience the complete functionality of the Bubble platform.
