The year 2025 is a truly remarkable milestone for Cardano.  
This year, we not only witnessed the birth and growth of many high-quality projects, but more importantly:  
**Cardano became the first Top 10 blockchain to achieve fully decentralized governance.**  
This marks a completely new era—one where the community truly owns the future of the network.  
However, after nearly a year of governance actions, we can clearly see:  
**Full decentralization unleashes capability, but also exposes systemic challenges.**  
The governance process revealed many structural weaknesses, including but not limited to:

1. **Off-chain discussions rely heavily on X**  
   Information is scattered, hard to track, and cannot be preserved.
2. **Governance portals are overly specialized**  
   Regular community members struggle to understand proposals, let alone track their progress.
3. **Lack of transparency for DReps**  
   Users cannot easily check their delegated DRep’s status and voting behavior.
4. **Communication gaps**  
   Ordinary users have almost no way to directly discuss issues or concerns with DReps.
5. **Lack of quantitative data for participation**  
   It’s difficult to evaluate DRep effort, leading to “brain-dead YES/NO voting.”
6. **Good governance lacks incentives**  
   No reputation system, no tipping tools—excellent DReps receive little recognition.

All these issues point toward a single reality:  
**After deep decentralization, the community must shoulder governance costs once handled by core teams.**  
This is an inevitable path for Cardano—and a double-edged sword.  
Beyond the execution problems above, the structural risks of “token-based governance” mentioned by Vitalik also cast a long shadow:

- **Wealth concentration → power concentration**  
- **Short-term price & market sentiment drive governance**  
- **Lengthy decision processes reduce competitiveness**

Without good tools, good information structures, and good participation experiences,  
**the more decentralized we become, the heavier the governance burden on the community.**

## **We believe the key to solving governance problems is not more rules, but better products.**
Although decentralized governance is challenging, Cardano’s foundational mechanisms already provide a strong base.  
As a team focused on product development, we aim to build on this foundation to  
**use product-led design to help ordinary users participate naturally, enable transparent information flow, amplify voices, quantify contributions, and make decentralization a strength—not a burden.**  
To achieve this, we designed the *Improve Cardano Governance* product framework, centered on the following capabilities:

### **1. A mobile-first lightweight app — Lowering the barrier to participation**
Most Cardano governance tools are built for developers or institutions.  
Our positioning is:

- Lightweight, simple, mobile-first  
- Focused on reading, discussing, and understanding governance  
- Lowering the learning cost for newcomers  

Decentralized governance should serve not just experts, but every ADA holder.

### **2. Aggregating governance-related discussions — Breaking information silos**
Today, governance discussions are scattered across X. We will:

- Automatically aggregate key discussions  
- Consolidate viewpoints into unified proposal pages  
- Structure topics with tags  

We want users to see diverse perspectives—not fragmented dialogues.

### **3. Multilingual translation — Enabling real global community dialogue**
Cardano is global, yet language silos still fragment the community.  
We will introduce:

- Multilingual translation  
- Consolidation of multilingual viewpoints  

For the first time, global Cardano communities can truly understand one another.

### **4. AI-powered summaries & proposal interpretation — Making governance understandable**
Most proposals are long, technical, and complex.  
We aim to use AI to provide:

- Proposal summaries  
- Key controversy highlights  
- Comparison of different viewpoints  
- Governance progress tracking  

Enabling users to understand within one minute:
- What happened  
- Why it matters  
- What the core issues are  
- What the community thinks  

Governance information becomes “plug-and-play.”

### **5. DRep intelligence and reputation system — Transparent & measurable**
Users need to know:
- Is my DRep active?  
- What did they vote? Why?  
- Did they study the proposal seriously?  
- Are they engaging with the community?  

Our tools will provide:
- Voting history & behavioral patterns  
- Alignment analysis between proposal content & voting  
- AI-generated DRep behavioral profiles  
- Activity & contribution scoring  

We also aim to introduce a community-driven reputation layer like [Ethos](https://www.ethos.network/),  
so dedicated DReps are visible, appreciated, and rewarded—  
allowing them to become the “stars” of the ecosystem.

## **Great products are leverage for decentralization**

As Cardano enters the era of full decentralization, the ecosystem faces unprecedented challenges.

Decentralization means:

- Creating value requires more collaboration  
- Information organization demands greater efficiency  
- Everyone becomes part of governance  

But we believe:

**Great products are powerful leverage. Through outstanding tool design, governance can become faster, more efficient, and ultimately a competitive edge for Cardano as it grows.**

The future of Cardano does not belong to any single team—it belongs to every ADA holder, every contributor, every community member shaping the ecosystem.

**Governance is our shared project.**  

**Let’s work together to make Cardano run better.**
