## Summary

Happy Lunar New Year! 🐍

Over the past month, VODA has hit several important milestones. We launched the Cardano ecosystem daily digest system with trilingual support (Chinese, English, Japanese), and we're now designing our next core feature — AI Roundtable, a multi-agent debate system for in-depth analysis of on-chain governance proposals.

## Cardano Daily Digest: Ecosystem Updates at Your Fingertips

VODA's core mission is to be the information aggregation platform for the Cardano community. We've now taken a major step forward: **automated daily Cardano ecosystem digests**.

Every day, the system automatically crawls tweets from 200+ Cardano ecosystem-related Twitter accounts, then uses AI to filter, score, and cluster-analyze the content into a structured daily report. Each digest covers five dimensions:

- **Key Highlights**: The 2-3 most important ecosystem developments
- **Governance Discussions**: DRep, SPO, and community discussions on proposals
- **Community Voices**: Perspectives and feedback from the global community
- **Technical Updates**: Protocol upgrades and development progress
- **Project News**: Latest developments from ecosystem projects

Every item includes links to the original tweets, so readers can trace back and verify the sources.

## Multilingual Support

As a product serving a global community, language should never be a barrier. Our daily digests currently support three languages simultaneously:

- 🇨🇳 中文 (Chinese)
- 🇺🇸 English
- 🇯🇵 日本語 (Japanese)

All language versions are published simultaneously on [voda.bubble-studio.xyz](https://voda.bubble-studio.xyz). We plan to add more languages based on community demand.

## What's Next: AI Roundtable

The daily digest solves the "what happened" question, but we want to go further — helping the community understand "what it means."

We're designing **AI Roundtable**, a multi-agent debate system purpose-built for deep analysis of Cardano governance proposals:

- **Three AI Roles**: Advocate, Critic, and Synthesizer engage in structured debate around real on-chain proposals
- **Logic Validation**: Each round of arguments is validated to ensure both sides are genuinely responding to each other's points, not talking past one another
- **On-chain Data Driven**: Debates are grounded in real voting data, treasury balances, DRep stake distributions, and other on-chain information — not abstract speculation
- **Open Participation**: Humans and third-party agents can inject messages during the debate to ask questions or provide additional context
- **Live Viewable**: The debate process is streamed to a web page in real-time — anyone can watch the AI deliberation unfold like a live broadcast

We believe good governance requires thorough information and diverse perspectives. AI Roundtable isn't meant to replace human judgment — it's designed to lay out arguments from both sides before you make your decision.

## Why Now

The market is bearish, but as developers, we see the other side of the coin.

Cardano is at the best moment in its history. Liquid staking, ultra-low pool operating costs, on-chain identity, agent economy protocols, Midnight privacy chain, Leios upgrades — the financial and trust infrastructure that AI Agents and one-person companies need is either mature or right around the corner on Cardano. We have nearly all the prerequisites to create an entirely new crypto narrative.

That's exactly why we chose this moment to build VODA. When the infrastructure is ready, what's missing is letting more people see what's happening here. The daily digest keeps information flowing, AI Roundtable takes discussions deeper — the rest is up to the community and builders.

Bear markets are tough, but they're also the greatest opportunity to leap forward. As indie developers, we'll keep building what we believe in on Cardano.

## Roadmap

- ✅ Cardano Ecosystem Daily Digest (Live)

VODA's vision remains unchanged: let everyone hear the **Voice of Ada**. We're just making that voice richer and deeper.

Wishing everyone a smooth ride through the cycle 🐍
