## Summary

Over the past two weeks, my day job has been extremely busy. However, with the
help of AI, we successfully completed the MVP development on schedule and
deployed it to [gov.bubble-studio.xyz](https://gov.bubble-studio.xyz).

Compared to our plan from two weeks ago, we cut some non-essential features, but
we made no compromises on core capabilities. We believe a solid foundation is
key to future expansion—with this strong starting point, subsequent feature
iterations will be much smoother.

## VODA

Another exciting development: our product finally has its own logo and
name—**VODA**.

VODA stands for **Voice of Ada**, and can also be interpreted as **Voltaire
Ada**. Both my wife and I are very happy with this name. It not only echoes the
core of Cardano's decentralized governance but also carries our fresh thinking
about the product.

We are not DReps, nor are we full-time Cardano community participants. As
ordinary people, we don't have time to deeply engage in discussions and analysis
of every community proposal.

Therefore, we hope VODA can become:

- A way for us to stay updated on Cardano ecosystem developments within our
  limited daily time
- A window for other cryptocurrency users, and even those outside the crypto
  space, to quickly understand Cardano ecosystem progress
- A voice that lets more people hear the Cardano community, recognizing that
  this is not a "ghost chain"—exciting things happen every day, with countless
  builders working here

## Next Steps

In the next version, we will:

1. Continue improving governance-related features
2. Begin developing Cardano community information aggregation capabilities

Let everyone truly hear the **Voice of Ada** through VODA.
