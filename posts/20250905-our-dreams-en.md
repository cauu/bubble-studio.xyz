Here, we wish to elaborate on the identity, mission, and the fundamental judgments upon which Bubble Studio acts. This article will answer two core questions: **Who are we? What do we plan to do?**
## Our Judgment
We believe we are at a pivotal historical juncture—the dawn of the "Sovereign Individual" era. This profound transformation is driven by two core forces: **Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Blockchain**.
- **Artificial Intelligence** is vastly enhancing individual productivity and creativity, elevating them to unprecedented levels.
- **Blockchain** provides a solid technological foundation for individual asset sovereignty and value transfer, heralding new possibilities for financial freedom.
We firmly believe that any entity or individual who can effectively integrate and leverage these two forces will gain a decisive strategic advantage in future survival and development.
    
## Our Mission and Plan
We have observed that the core capability of blockchain—"**decentralization**"—has its immense potential yet to be fully explored by the market. It is even intentionally marginalized in some mainstream, capital-driven projects.

We see this perception as short-sighted. Decentralization is not merely a technical feature; it is a powerful tool that empowers individuals and fosters new models of collaboration. Among the many public chains, Cardano, with its excellent design and firm commitment to decentralization, provides us with an ideal platform for practice. Its advantages are specifically reflected in:

1. **Extremely Low Node Operation Costs**: Its unique consensus mechanism allows creators to generate a stable and continuous cash flow by operating personal nodes, providing a solid economic foundation for independent creative activities.
2. **Powerful Protocol Composability**: Cardano's underlying architecture supports the flexible combination of various decentralized protocols, enabling the emergence of entirely new business models and application scenarios at a very low cost.
3. **Comprehensive Decentralized Governance**: It offers a unique on-chain governance platform that can directly and efficiently link technical talent and innovative ideas with economic returns and the realization of personal value.
Based on our profound recognition of Cardano's decentralized capabilities, we have established the mission of Bubble Studio: **To continuously build efficient and practical applications within the Cardano ecosystem and actively explore the boundaries of decentralization.**

At this stage, our core objective is: **To provide the Cardano community with a top-tier Governance application.**

To achieve this goal, our product will adhere to the following core principles:
- **Mobile-First**: Ensuring a seamless and fluid core experience on mobile devices.
- **Permissionless and Community-Governed**: The application will have no pre-censorship; its rules and future development will be entirely led by the community.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Committed to eliminating language barriers to serve Cardano community members worldwide.
- **AI-Driven**: Leveraging artificial intelligence to enhance the application's intelligence and the efficiency of user decision-making.

Regarding funding, we have a clear stance: **At the current stage, we will not request any funds from the community or the treasury.** All our development activities will be entirely sustained by the operational revenue of our own Cardano stake pool.

This decision is based on three strategic considerations:
1. **To Ensure Development Independence and Original Intent**: We wish to avoid the delivery pressure from external funding that could affect our product's design pace and quality standards.
2. **Trust Must Be Earned Through Tangible Results**: As a team that has not yet delivered any product to the community, we believe it is premature to seek funding before achieving substantial results. We choose to build our reputation with our product.
3. **Long-Term Value-ism**: We believe that continuous value creation is the only way to build community reputation and trust, and we are willing to invest the time and patience to do so.

## Our Persistence and Beliefs

Choosing such a path stems from our firm beliefs:
1. **We are staunch supporters of the "Sovereign Individual" narrative.** We believe that Cardano, with its highly decentralized nature, offers the most ideal platform to realize this vision.
2. **Creative freedom requires economic independence.** For independent creators, commercialization often means compromising their original intentions. Cardano's staking mechanism offers a new possibility: creators can have a stable cash flow to sustain their work without having to sacrifice their creative independence and vision under commercial pressure.
3. **To provide a model for independent developers.** Through our own practice, we hope to demonstrate that it is entirely feasible for independent developers to achieve creative freedom by operating a Cardano node, thereby attracting more like-minded developers to this ecosystem.
4. **To safeguard the core value of decentralization.** While many blockchain projects choose to embrace capital and pursue short-term growth, Cardano remains committed to Satoshi Nakamoto's vision of decentralization. This is a more arduous path. By attracting more value-driven independent developers, rather than participating in capital-dumping games, we hope to contribute real, sustainable value to the Cardano ecosystem. We do not want it to fail.

We look forward to contributing our strength to the Cardano ecosystem through concrete actions.
