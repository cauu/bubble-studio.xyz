Finally, using a conservative conversion rate of 0.5 ADA (`₳`) per USD (`$`) at the date of the withdrawal, we formulate a budget of **`₳1,500,000` (1.5M)**.\n\n> **NOTE**\n>\n> The Networking scope described in our [design documentation](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru/blob/main/engineering-decision-records/006-design-phase-documentation.md) is included in our proposal for reference but is already covered by a [Catalyst proposal](https://projectcatalyst.io/funds/12/cardano-open-developers/amaru-p2p-networking-component-by-txpipe). It is fully managed by Santiago.\n\n## Administration of the budget\n\nThe [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) maintainer committee will ensure **direct administration** of the budget, assisted with **an on-chain smart contract** (developed in open source, still incomplete, but aimed to be done and fully audited by the time of the first withdrawal).\n\nThe fund management, responsibilities and remuneration of contributors will follow PRAGMA's legal framework provided in annex under [PRAGMA Maintainer Committee Framework](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafkreiabxyva5lfm6zztg7tnktxvvbbucljrce7hlrp4p6hropqzfaip3y).\n\nIn addition, the smart contract's role is to ensure that the expenditure of funds is done in accordance with the scope defined in this budget and authorized by the relevant scope owners.\n\nWe recognize the following capabilities of this contract:\n\n1. **Standard withdrawal**: A scope owner asks other scope owners for money to be withdrawn from his scope.\n2. **Contingency withdrawal**: A scope owner asks other scope owners to withdraw an amount from the contingency funds.\n3. **Scope reconciliation**: A scope owner asks other scope owners for a change of ownership (or a reallocation of budget).\n4. **Contingency refund/closing**: scope owners ask to send the leftovers from the contingency budget to be sent back to the Cardano treasury.\n5. **Credential rotation**: In case of lost credentials or the departure of a scope owner, a mechanism allows the rotation of credentials to a new scope owner upon approval by all (5 out of 5) PRAGMA members (effectively capturing PRAGMA's board decision to appoint new maintainers).\n6. **Failsafe**: In the extreme scenario where credentials would be irremediably lost, thus preventing any further decision, a failsafe mechanism allows all unconsumed funds to be sent back to the Cardano treasury.\n\n## Reporting\n\n#### Quarterly reports\n\nFollowing [PRAGMA's Decision Record 006](https://github.com/pragma-org/PDRs/tree/main/PDR-0006-Project-Reporting), progress on [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) shall be **at least reported quarterly**. The content of [these reports](https://pragma.io/projects/amaru#quarterly-reports) is straightforward and includes the following:\n\n- Problems that require board attention (infrastructure, trademarks, etc.)\n- Project status (active, inactive, initiating, etc.)\n- A changelog (last committer addition)\n- Next planned steps (new releases, significant changes, etc.)\n- Reflection & Performances\n\nThis recurrent interaction will provide an overview of the project with a long-term perspective and support the maintainers' committee in aligning priorities and identifying the next steps. The outcome of these reviews will be publicly available as documentation in [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru)'s GitHub repository.\n\n#### Regular demos\n\nAmaru is demo-driven. We strive to integrate early and provide runnable examples showcasing the latest features as the project is being developed. The cadence for these demos is around 4 to 6 weeks, as illustrated on the [existing track record](https://pragma.io/projects/amaru#demos).\n\nWe will naturally continue to **record and post demos regularly**.\n\n## Constitutionality checklist\n\nBeing one of the first proposals of this nature ever submitted, it is easy to get things wrong. In an effort to convince ourselves of its constitutionality, we thought relevant to include a checklist of the points we cover and for each, our interpretation of the Cardano Constitution.\n\n#### Purpose\n\n- [x] This proposal is for work intended to enhance the security, decentralization and long-term sustainability of Cardano.\n\n#### Article III.5: the process of on-chain governance\n\n- [x] We have submitted this proposal in a standardized, legible format, which includes a URL and hash of all documented off-chain content. We believe our rationale to be detailed and sufficient. The proposal contains a title, abstract, reason for the proposal and relevant supporting materials.\n\n#### Article IV.1: proposing budgets\n\n- [x] This proposal accords with the provisions of this article as it is intended to cover the maintenance and future development of the Cardano Blockchain.\n\n- [x] This proposal covers a shorter period than 73 epochs, which is permitted in this section of the Constitution, to match the Net-Change Limit period.\n\n#### Article IV.2: funds administration\n\n- [x] This proposal specifies an administrator in accordance with this provision. It also specifies an internal administration process using smart contracts and an off-chain overseeing committee, meeting the requirements of this clause, which requires a process that may include an administrator.\n\n#### Article IV.3: Net-Change Limit\n\n- [x] Being of ₳1.5M and covering the second half of 2025, this proposal and the treasury withdrawals it would enable do not violate the currently agreed upon Net-Change Limit.\n\n#### Article IV.4: Auditor\n\n- [x] This proposal makes provisions for an auditor (covered by the _Ad-hoc mercenaries_ scope).\n\n#### Guardrails\n\n- [x] This proposal is subject to _TREASURY-04a_ in that it defines a Cardano blockchain ecosystem budget. It requires a threshold greater than 50% of the DReps' active voting stake to be considered approved and enable subsequent withdrawals pertaining to this budget.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) project represents a major step towards node diversity through the development of a modular, high-performance, and interoperable block-producing node for Cardano. Our approach, rooted in openness, innovation, and operational resilience, aims to deliver significant advancements in blockchain technology without compromising on security.\n\nIn addition to this budget, we provide a detailed document outlining:\n\n- explicit assumptions about the project, the valuation and the scopes covered;\n- comparisons to similar projects of developing blockchain nodes; and\n- the methodology used for managing the project, its deliveries, its finance and its governance.\n\nThrough rigorous design and execution phases, we have outlined actionable scopes, realistic timelines, and comprehensive resource allocations. The detailed breakdown of scopes, funding and resources already secured reflects our commitment to transparency and efficiency. While we remain optimistic about our forecasts, we acknowledge the complexities involved and have incorporated contingencies to address unforeseen challenges.\n\nMore than a mere budget, this proposal is an invitation to collaborate and innovate together. The [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) project is ambitious yet achievable through the collective effort of our contributors and the broader Cardano community. By focusing on building, learning, and demonstrating tangible progress, [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) paves the way for a more resilient and decentralized Cardano ecosystem, ensuring long-term reliability and innovation.\n\nLet's build the future of Cardano together.",

          "motivation": "## Who we are\n\n[Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) is a multi-entity effort that currently sits under [PRAGMA](https://pragma.io): a member-based, not-for-profit open-source association for blockchain software projects. Five members with equal power currently drive PRAGMA's strategy and operations: Blink Labs, Cardano Foundation, dcSpark, Sundae Labs, and TxPipe. Each of them has a proven track record of building on Cardano and supporting our ecosystem.\n\n[Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) itself is managed by an appointed maintainer committee in charge of different scopes. The current maintainer committee comprises of:\n\n- [Arnaud Bailly](https://github.com/abailly) responsible for the consensus and simulation testing.\n- [Matthias Benkort](https://github.com/ktorz) responsible for the ledger & overall architecture.\n- [Pi Lanningham](https://github.com/Quantumplation) responsible for the ad hoc work and middleware integrations.\n- [Santiago Carmuega](https://github.com/scarmuega) responsible for the p2p networking.\n- [Damien Czapla](https://github.com/Dam-CZ) responsible for the project management, public relations & marketing.\n\nEach member of the maintainer committee is in charge of a scope and has oversight on its delivery, which includes managing an associated budget.\n\n## Why build another node\n\nOne of Cardano's key assets is its legendary robustness and stability, which is mainly attributed to the existing Haskell node, which has been working without significant disruption for about five years now (counting since the Byron reboot, circa February 2020).\n\nSo why bother with another node? The answer is, of course, plural:\n\n#### 1. **Better resource usage**\n\nSoftware is ultimately a collection of design decisions and trade-offs. Some of those trade-offs in the Haskell node have led to rather high resource usages (e.g., resident memory), thus leading to the creation of specific protocol parameters (e.g., min-utxo-value) as countermeasures to ensure resource usage remains somewhat bounded. Our analysis is that different (albeit acceptable) trade-offs would yield better resource usage.\n\n#### 2. **Industry-grade observability**\n\nObservability is challenging, and it is even more so when rolling your own solution. With [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru), we intend to embrace industry standards for monitoring, tracing, and logging to drastically enhance the user experience for operators seeking insights into their node's behaviour.\n\n#### 3. **Enhanced interoperability**\n\n[Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) being primarily written in Rust means that we can more easily leverage an existing and thriving ecosystem of blockchain solutions and aim at multiple target platforms (e.g. web-assembly, RISC-V). This opens up not only to a wide variety of potential contributors but also to many new use cases that are much harder (not to say unrealistic) to achieve with a Haskell node.\n\n#### 4. **Higher-assurance & robustness**\n\nDeveloping a new implementation of existing software means dissecting every part of the original implementation. Along the way, bugs and discrepancies with the specification are commonly found through conformance testing. Gaps in the documentation can also be identified and addressed. The development of [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) has already proven this on several occasions. In the long run, more node implementations can be a synonym for reduced development time by allowing all implementations to converge faster towards better designs and more robust implementations.\n\n#### 5. **Decentralization**\n\nIn a world where Byzantine fault tolerance is at the centre and where decentralization is a paramount value, we believe that a single-node implementation presents a single point of failure and a central point of control. A new node not only increases the overall resilience of the network but also provides perspectives in terms of a roadmap and use cases.\n\n---\n\nWith [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru), we believe that we can reconcile these goals while preserving Cardano's focus on security and robustness. Like Haskell, Rust is a statically typed language that provides strong compile-time guarantees and fine-grained memory management. Its ecosystem is also well-equipped for high assurance, making it a sane choice for implementing blockchain solutions.",

It covers the whole of 2025.\n\n| Scope                                            | Owner    | Estimated effort | Resources already secured | Resources needed |\n| ---                                              | ---      | ---              | ---                       | ---              |\n| Ledger                                           | Matthias | 2.5 FTEs         | 1 FTE                     | 1.5 FTEs         |\n| Consensus and simulation                         | Arnaud   | 2.5 FTEs         | 1 FTE                     | 1.5 FTEs         |\n| Networking                                       | Santiago | 1 FTE            | 1 FTE                     | 0 FTEs           |\n| Ad-hoc Mercenaries                               | Pi       | 2.5 FTEs         | 0 FTEs                    | 2.5 FTEs         |\n| Project Management, Public Relations & Marketing | Damien   | 0.5 FTEs         | 0 FTEs                    | 0.5 FTEs         |\n\nThe total resources without funding for 2025 adds up to **6 FTEs**. Considering this budget ask is only for **the second half of 2025**, it halves to `$600,000` (600K) once converted to USD (`$`). We then add a 25% contingency budget to cope with our optimistic bias: we are aware that our forecast is subject to underestimating complexity, overlooking challenges, and undervaluing the time and cost required to deliver.\n\nWith this contingency, we end up at **`$750,000` (750K)**. Finally, using a conservative conversion rate of 0.5 ADA (`₳`) per USD (`$`) at the date of the withdrawal, we formulate a budget of **`₳1,500,000` (1.5M)**.\n\n> **NOTE**\n>\n> The Networking scope described in our [design documentation](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru/blob/main/engineering-decision-records/006-design-phase-documentation.md) is included in our proposal for reference but is already covered by a [Catalyst proposal](https://projectcatalyst.io/funds/12/cardano-open-developers/amaru-p2p-networking-component-by-txpipe). It is fully managed by Santiago.\n\n## Administration of the budget\n\nThe [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) maintainer committee will ensure **direct administration** of the budget, assisted with **an on-chain smart contract** (developed in open source, still incomplete, but aimed to be done and fully audited by the time of the first withdrawal).\n\nThe fund management, responsibilities and remuneration of contributors will follow PRAGMA's legal framework provided in annex under [PRAGMA Maintainer Committee Framework](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafkreiabxyva5lfm6zztg7tnktxvvbbucljrce7hlrp4p6hropqzfaip3y).\n\nIn addition, the smart contract's role is to ensure that the expenditure of funds is done in accordance with the scope defined in this budget and authorized by the relevant scope owners.\n\nWe recognize the following capabilities of this contract:\n\n1. **Standard withdrawal**: A scope owner asks other scope owners for money to be withdrawn from his scope.\n2. **Contingency withdrawal**: A scope owner asks other scope owners to withdraw an amount from the contingency funds.\n3. **Scope reconciliation**: A scope owner asks other scope owners for a change of ownership (or a reallocation of budget).\n4. **Contingency refund/closing**: scope owners ask to send the leftovers from the contingency budget to be sent back to the Cardano treasury.\n5. **Credential rotation**: In case of lost credentials or the departure of a scope owner, a mechanism allows the rotation of credentials to a new scope owner upon approval by all (5 out of 5) PRAGMA members (effectively capturing PRAGMA's board decision to appoint new maintainers).\n6. **Failsafe**: In the extreme scenario where credentials would be irremediably lost, thus preventing any further decision, a failsafe mechanism allows all unconsumed funds to be sent back to the Cardano treasury.\n\n## Reporting\n\n#### Quarterly reports\n\nFollowing [PRAGMA's Decision Record 006](https://github.com/pragma-org/PDRs/tree/main/PDR-0006-Project-Reporting), progress on [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) shall be **at least reported quarterly**. The content of [these reports](https://pragma.io/projects/amaru#quarterly-reports) is straightforward and includes the following:\n\n- Problems that require board attention (infrastructure, trademarks, etc.)\n- Project status (active, inactive, initiating, etc.)\n- A changelog (last committer addition)\n- Next planned steps (new releases, significant changes, etc.)\n- Reflection & Performances\n\nThis recurrent interaction will provide an overview of the project with a long-term perspective and support the maintainers' committee in aligning priorities and identifying the next steps. The outcome of these reviews will be publicly available as documentation in [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru)'s GitHub repository.\n\n#### Regular demos\n\nAmaru is demo-driven. We strive to integrate early and provide runnable examples showcasing the latest features as the project is being developed. The cadence for these demos is around 4 to 6 weeks, as illustrated on the [existing track record](https://pragma.io/projects/amaru#demos).\n\nWe will naturally continue to **record and post demos regularly**.\n\n## Constitutionality checklist\n\nBeing one of the first proposals of this nature ever submitted, it is easy to get things wrong. In an effort to convince ourselves of its constitutionality, we thought relevant to include a checklist of the points we cover and for each, our interpretation of the Cardano Constitution.\n\n#### Purpose\n\n- [x] This proposal is for work intended to enhance the security, decentralization and long-term sustainability of Cardano.\n\n#### Article III.5: the process of on-chain governance\n\n- [x] We have submitted this proposal in a standardized, legible format, which includes a URL and hash of all documented off-chain content. We believe our rationale to be detailed and sufficient. The proposal contains a title, abstract, reason for the proposal and relevant supporting materials.\n\n#### Article IV.1: proposing budgets\n\n- [x] This proposal accords with the provisions of this article as it is intended to cover the maintenance and future development of the Cardano Blockchain.\n\n- [x] This proposal covers a shorter period than 73 epochs, which is permitted in this section of the Constitution, to match the Net-Change Limit period.\n\n#### Article IV.2: funds administration\n\n- [x] This proposal specifies an administrator in accordance with this provision. It also specifies an internal administration process using smart contracts and an off-chain overseeing committee, meeting the requirements of this clause, which requires a process that may include an administrator.\n\n#### Article IV.3: Net-Change Limit\n\n- [x] Being of ₳1.5M and covering the second half of 2025, this proposal and the treasury withdrawals it would enable do not violate the currently agreed upon Net-Change Limit.\n\n#### Article IV.4: Auditor\n\n- [x] This proposal makes provisions for an auditor (covered by the _Ad-hoc mercenaries_ scope).\n\n#### Guardrails\n\n- [x] This proposal is subject to _TREASURY-04a_ in that it defines a Cardano blockchain ecosystem budget. It requires a threshold greater than 50% of the DReps' active voting stake to be considered approved and enable subsequent withdrawals pertaining to this budget.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) project represents a major step towards node diversity through the development of a modular, high-performance, and interoperable block-producing node for Cardano. Our approach, rooted in openness, innovation, and operational resilience, aims to deliver significant advancements in blockchain technology without compromising on security.\n\nIn addition to this budget, we provide a detailed document outlining:\n\n- explicit assumptions about the project, the valuation and the scopes covered;\n- comparisons to similar projects of developing blockchain nodes; and\n- the methodology used for managing the project, its deliveries, its finance and its governance.\n\nThrough rigorous design and execution phases, we have outlined actionable scopes, realistic timelines, and comprehensive resource allocations. The detailed breakdown of scopes, funding and resources already secured reflects our commitment to transparency and efficiency. While we remain optimistic about our forecasts, we acknowledge the complexities involved and have incorporated contingencies to address unforeseen challenges.\n\nMore than a mere budget, this proposal is an invitation to collaborate and innovate together. The [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) project is ambitious yet achievable through the collective effort of our contributors and the broader Cardano community. By focusing on building, learning, and demonstrating tangible progress, [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) paves the way for a more resilient and decentralized Cardano ecosystem, ensuring long-term reliability and innovation.\n\nLet's build the future of Cardano together.",

        "motivation": "## Who we are\n\n[Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) is a multi-entity effort that currently sits under [PRAGMA](https://pragma.io): a member-based, not-for-profit open-source association for blockchain software projects. Five members with equal power currently drive PRAGMA's strategy and operations: Blink Labs, Cardano Foundation, dcSpark, Sundae Labs, and TxPipe. Each of them has a proven track record of building on Cardano and supporting our ecosystem.\n\n[Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) itself is managed by an appointed maintainer committee in charge of different scopes. The current maintainer committee comprises of:\n\n- [Arnaud Bailly](https://github.com/abailly) responsible for the consensus and simulation testing.\n- [Matthias Benkort](https://github.com/ktorz) responsible for the ledger & overall architecture.\n- [Pi Lanningham](https://github.com/Quantumplation) responsible for the ad hoc work and middleware integrations.\n- [Santiago Carmuega](https://github.com/scarmuega) responsible for the p2p networking.\n- [Damien Czapla](https://github.com/Dam-CZ) responsible for the project management, public relations & marketing.\n\nEach member of the maintainer committee is in charge of a scope and has oversight on its delivery, which includes managing an associated budget.\n\n## Why build another node\n\nOne of Cardano's key assets is its legendary robustness and stability, which is mainly attributed to the existing Haskell node, which has been working without significant disruption for about five years now (counting since the Byron reboot, circa February 2020).\n\nSo why bother with another node? The answer is, of course, plural:\n\n#### 1. **Better resource usage**\n\nSoftware is ultimately a collection of design decisions and trade-offs. Some of those trade-offs in the Haskell node have led to rather high resource usages (e.g., resident memory), thus leading to the creation of specific protocol parameters (e.g., min-utxo-value) as countermeasures to ensure resource usage remains somewhat bounded. Our analysis is that different (albeit acceptable) trade-offs would yield better resource usage.\n\n#### 2. **Industry-grade observability**\n\nObservability is challenging, and it is even more so when rolling your own solution. With [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru), we intend to embrace industry standards for monitoring, tracing, and logging to drastically enhance the user experience for operators seeking insights into their node's behaviour.\n\n#### 3. **Enhanced interoperability**\n\n[Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) being primarily written in Rust means that we can more easily leverage an existing and thriving ecosystem of blockchain solutions and aim at multiple target platforms (e.g. web-assembly, RISC-V). This opens up not only to a wide variety of potential contributors but also to many new use cases that are much harder (not to say unrealistic) to achieve with a Haskell node.\n\n#### 4. **Higher-assurance & robustness**\n\nDeveloping a new implementation of existing software means dissecting every part of the original implementation. Along the way, bugs and discrepancies with the specification are commonly found through conformance testing. Gaps in the documentation can also be identified and addressed. The development of [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) has already proven this on several occasions. In the long run, more node implementations can be a synonym for reduced development time by allowing all implementations to converge faster towards better designs and more robust implementations.\n\n#### 5. **Decentralization**\n\nIn a world where Byzantine fault tolerance is at the centre and where decentralization is a paramount value, we believe that a single-node implementation presents a single point of failure and a central point of control. A new node not only increases the overall resilience of the network but also provides perspectives in terms of a roadmap and use cases.\n\n---\n\nWith [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru), we believe that we can reconcile these goals while preserving Cardano's focus on security and robustness. Like Haskell, Rust is a statically typed language that provides strong compile-time guarantees and fine-grained memory management. Its ecosystem is also well-equipped for high assurance, making it a sane choice for implementing blockchain solutions.",

        "summary": "The Amaru Node Development 2025 proposal seeks ₳1.5 million in funding for the second half of 2025 to develop Amaru, an open-source, Rust-based, alternative block-producing node for Cardano. The project is led by PRAGMA, a consortium of established Cardano ecosystem entities. The intended goal is to enhance Cardano's network resilience, decentralization, and performance by introducing client diversity, reducing reliance on the primary Haskell-based node, and attracting a wider pool of developers through Rust. This initiative aligns with Cardano's strategic priority of evolving its technical infrastructure, particularly in areas of core protocol robustness and developer ecosystem expansion, against a competitive landscape where network performance and decentralization are key differentiators.",
        "myOpinion": "I strongly support the Amaru Node Development 2025 proposal. It directly addresses a fundamental requirement for any mature blockchain: client diversity. This is not merely a 'nice-to-have' but a critical component for enhancing network security, resilience against bugs or attacks, and true decentralization, moving away from reliance on a single core client. The choice of Rust is forward-thinking, likely to expand Cardano's developer community and potentially bring performance benefits. PRAGMA's involvement lends significant credibility. The requested budget is modest for an undertaking of this importance and potential impact. While the technical challenge of maintaining multiple clients is real, it is a necessary complexity for a platform aspiring to be a global financial and social operating system. The benefits of increased robustness, reduced systemic risk, and a more vibrant developer ecosystem far outweigh the manageable costs and technical coordination overhead. This proposal aligns perfectly with Cardano's long-term strategic objectives of creating a secure, sustainable, and efficient blockchain, and investing in high-quality engineering for critical infrastructure like Amaru is paramount."

Shrink down both Catalyst/Intersect budgets significantly and put them to a vote. I’ll likely support them."

I voted NO for all others.\n\nNumber of supported projects across categories:\n\n• Core: 17\n• Research: 2\n• Marketing & Innovation: 2\n• Governance support: 2\n\nThe 3 largest projects I supported are IOG Core development, IO Research, and Catalyst. \n\nThese 3 items account for 193M ADA.\n\nI was hesitant to support IOG research. In the past, many academic papers have been published. We do not need all the research items on the list for next year. Now it is necessary to support implementation and the ecosystem more, which, in my opinion, is lagging behind research.\n\nOn the other hand, Cardano's success is largely based on research and quality implementation using formal methods. \n\nNot supporting research would be a step aside. Some of the things on the list may be implemented in the future.\n\nMy recommendation for next time is to create a separate proposal for each item instead of one proposal with many items. This also applies to Core development.\n\nAs I mentioned before, I consider Catalyst to be the place where most projects should apply for funding. That is why I support it.\n\nDuring the review of Budget Proposals, I noticed that in many cases, only about 2-3 DReps voted. In the best case, about 10, rarely around 20. This is a very low participation.\n\nCatalyst is not perfect, but it has been improved for several years, the team is experienced, and it is a battle-tested tool. ADA holders are already familiar with the system. Moreover, further improvements are planned.\n\nAt this point, I see no reason to replace Catalyst with Budget Proposals.\n\nMy other recommendation is that IOG should submit separate GAs for their proposals once the NCL is approved. This will avoid the situation where DReps vote on a GA with many other items in one GA.\n\nI only used 29M ADA to support the other 23 projects. \n\nThese are projects that, in my opinion, the ecosystem desperately needs.\n\nI consider Midgard, Starstream, Hydra, ZK Rollups, an alternative Cardano node, integration with Bitcoin, and several others to be must-have projects.\n\nIf I came across multiple similar proposals, I preferred open-source projects and entities that are well-known to the community or have delivered a project that is still in use today.\n\nI would like to emphasize that if I voted NO, it could mean:\n\n• I don't like the project. It shouldn't be funded from Treasury (or Catalyst).\n\n• I like the project, and it should apply for funding from Catalyst.\n\nIn general, I think that projects with ambitions to be commercially successful should look for other sources of funding. \n\nI don't like it when a risky business is funded from the Treasury, and in case of success, the profit is privatized.\n\nIf projects apply for Treasury funding, they should have a strategy on how to return part of the profit back to the community in case of success.\n\nFurthermore, I think that if it is a startup, the team cannot expect that devs will be paid the same salaries as IOG devs. Part of the risk must be borne by the team, not just Treasury.\n\nSome projects do not have a commercial character, for example, libraries, dev tools, etc. We should identify these projects, evaluate their benefits, and possibly support them.\n\nThe last major project I supported was the Marketing Strategy from the Cardano Foundation. This also includes the Cardano Summit.\n\nIn general, I do not want to support projects from founding entities that hold Genesis coins and have not spent them yet. The Cardano Foundation is such an entity, which was negatively reflected in the last Catalyst Fund.\n\nOn the other hand, this proposal was the best in the marketing category. The Cardano Foundation supports many activities in the ecosystem. CF wants to remain active in the long term and support building the ecosystem, for which it needs to secure funding.\n\nThe costs of the Cardano Summit and other marketing activities can be high. I would not like to risk that if their proposal is not approved, the next Cardano Summit will not be organized. The crypto industry could perceive this negatively.\n\nI have only supported a single proposal from Intersect regarding the budget for open-source development. They are asking for 5.8M ADA.\n\nNew proposals appear every day, so my decision may not be final.  I may make changes.\n\nMy DRep ID:\ndrep1km69g7ksf8t5g0h9d9tkrcd2tezxelx0wtr76rv2mrkl5nzd6v3",

We are still at the beginning — but it’s a promising one.\n\nIF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A DREP MY ID IS: drep1y2jd3c4hgg0tdua58z6c64k9rf58lz3jlcjlxcjfeaspl6q2e9zm6\n\nProposals I voted YES for: \n\n- Cardano Maintenance and Roadmap Delivery Proposal: Secure Ada Network Infrastructure for the enTire cardano communitY\n- Input Output Research (IOR): Cardano Vision - Work Program 2025\n- A member-based organization for the Cardano ecosystem: Intersect\n- Beyond Minimum Viable Governance: Iteratively Improving on Cardano Voltaire\n- The Cardano community's open-source tool for participation in its governance: Cardano Govtool\n- Cardano Product Committee: Community-driven - 2030 Cardano Vision and 2026 roadmap insights collection via workshops and structured product research\n- 2025 Input Output Engineering Core Development Proposal\n- UTxO RPC: Sustaining Cardano Blockchain Integration\n- Dolos: Sustaining a Lightweight Cardano Data Node\n- Pallas: Sustaining Critical Rust Tooling for Cardano\n- MLabs Core Tool Maintenance & Enhancement: Ply\n- MLabs Core Tool Maintenance & Enhancement: CLB\n- MLabs Maintenance & Enhancement: Atlas PAB\n- MLabs Core Tool Maintenance & Enhancement: Cardano Transaction Library (CTL)\n- MLabs Core Tool Maintenance & Enhancement: Plutarch\n- Extended Symbolic\n- Lucid Evolution Maintenance\n- OSC Budget Proposal - Paid Open Source Model for Sustainable Development\n- zkFold ZK Rollup\n- Atlas PAB: Hydra and L2 Integration (Midgard, Midnight, ZkFold)\n- Blockfrost Platform Community Budget Proposal\n- Extended UPLC Converter\n- Complete Web3 developer stack to make Cardano the smart contract layer for Bitcoin\n- Midgard - Optimistic Rollups\n- Gerolamo - cardano node in typescript\n- Atlas PAB - Chainlink Oracle Integration\n- ZK Bridge\n- Atlas PAB: Aiken and Governance Integration\n - Atlas PAB: Hydra and L2 Integration (Midgard, Midnight, ZkFold)\n- AdaStat..net Cardano blockchain explorer\n- Quality Assurance: On-Chain & Off-Chain Audit\n- ADAspending,com - Cardano Treasury Explorer - An open data source for tracking treasury spending on the Cardano blockchain\n- DRep Incentivization Framework\n- SyncGovHub: An intelligent Transparent, and Action-Oriented Platform for Cardano Governance\n- Cardano Constitutional Committee Formation and - Governance Training with the SanchoNet Education Network\n- Cardano Governance MCP: natural language access to governance data\n- The Cardano community's open-source tool for participation in its governance: Cardano Govtool\n- Membership & Community Committee (MCC) - Global Community Hubs Expansion Program\n- Cardano Summit 2025 and regional tech events\n- Cardano Builder DAO\n- Marketing Infrastructure for Cardano\n- Amplify Cardano: Community-Led Events Fund by Rare Network\n- Amplify Cardano: Community-Led Marketing Fund by - Rare Network\n- Business Lead Generation on Cardano\n- Cardano Ecosystem Pavilions at Exhibitions\n- A.L.B.A. Network\n- Cardano Curation Short-Form Video Marketing Initiative\n- Catalyst 2025 Proposal by Input Output: Advancing Decentralised Community Innovation Funding & Infrastructure\n- Growth & Marketing Committee (GMC) Budget Proposal"

When multiple independent teams build node software, it reduces reliance on a single entity, such as IOG in the case of Cardano. \n\nIt minimizes the systemic risks associated with monoculture software development.\n\nOne of the core promises of blockchain networks is high availability, including strong resistance to attacks and censorship. \n\nWhile no system can guarantee 100% uptime, having multiple node implementations increases the network’s robustness. If a bug or vulnerability is present in one version, others may remain unaffected, limiting potential damage.\n\nEncouraging additional node implementations also deepens understanding of the protocol. As more developers build and maintain nodes, they contribute to refining the protocol specification, surfacing ambiguities, and improving long-term maintainability. \n\nThis also supports future clients by setting a clearer and more battle-tested standard.\n\nFor comparison, Bitcoin is largely dependent on a single implementation: Bitcoin Core. While there are alternatives (e.g., btcd, Bitcoin Knots), they are rarely used, making the network heavily reliant on a single development team. \n\nThis centralization becomes especially visible during governance disputes, such as those surrounding the use of the OP_RETURN opcode and Ordinals.\n\nIn contrast, Ethereum has multiple actively maintained implementations for both its consensus and execution layers.

          "text": "As Cardano’s 2025 budget process gains momentum, multiple proposals have emerged to reassess the Net Change Limit (NCL). Here’s a breakdown of the current situation:\n\n✅ Approved: The 2025 NCL of 350M ADA has been formally ratified by DReps. It’s based on a 2024 treasury income model (approx. 336M ADA) and now serves as the foundation for current budget deliberations.\n\n❌ Rejected: A more conservative proposal to cap 2025 at 300M ADA and 2026 at 250M ADA was not approved.\n\n🟠 Under Review:\n“2025 Cardano NCL” proposes lowering the NCL to 200M ADA, urging a cautious approach during this first year of decentralized treasury governance.\n“300M ADA for Epochs 563–635” aims to establish an NCL for early 2026, supporting budget continuity across overlapping periods.\n\nMeanwhile, several new funding proposals have been submitted:\n\n1⃣ 7.5M ADA for Community Builder Proposals — includes only those with ≥2.69B ADA support, excluding proposals from Intersect and founding entities.\n\n2⃣ 1.5M ADA for Amaru Rust Node Development — a PRAGMA-led initiative to diversify Cardano nodes and enhance network resilience.\n\n3⃣ 50M ADA for DeFi Liquidity — aims to seed liquidity into DEXs and stablecoins, with yield partially returned to the treasury.\n\nAs SIPO DRep, we’re evaluating these developments based on:\n\n🔍 Cautious governance: supports the 200M ADA NCL.\n🚀 Growth & momentum: supports maintaining the 350M ADA cap.\n⚖️ Balanced compromise: 300M ADA could be a pragmatic middle ground.\n\nFor funding proposals, our assessment will focus on:\nDoes it generate a return to the treasury?\nIs transparency and execution capacity ensured?\nDoes it set a strong precedent for the first year of decentralized financial governance?\n\nThe NCL is more than just a number — it reflects Cardano’s financial philosophy and growth trajectory. Changing the cap directly impacts which proposals are viable.\n\nWe’ll soon publish SIPO’s evaluation criteria and vote logic for each major proposal. In the meantime, we welcome your input before the voting begins.\n\nIf you support our work as a DRep, please consider delegating:\n\nDRep ID:\ndrep1yffld2866p00cyg3ejjdewtvazgah7jjgk0s9m7m5ytmmdq33v3zh\n\nFor Daedalus:\ndrep120m237kstm7pzywv5nwtjm8gj8dl55j9nupwlkapz77mgv7zu7l",

          "originalText": "As Cardano’s 2025 budget process gains momentum, multiple proposals have emerged to reassess the Net Change Limit (NCL). Here’s a breakdown of the current situation:\n\n✅ Approved: The 2025 NCL of 350M ADA has been formally ratified by DReps. It’s based on a 2024 treasury income model (approx. 336M ADA) and now serves as the foundation for current budget deliberations.\n\n❌ Rejected: A more conservative proposal to cap 2025 at 300M ADA and 2026 at 250M ADA was not approved.\n\n🟠 Under Review:\n“2025 Cardano NCL” proposes lowering the NCL to 200M ADA, urging a cautious approach during this first year of decentralized treasury governance.\n“300M ADA for Epochs 563–635” aims to establish an NCL for early 2026, supporting budget continuity across overlapping periods.\n\nMeanwhile, several new funding proposals have been submitted:\n\n1⃣ 7.5M ADA for Community Builder Proposals — includes only those with ≥2.69B ADA support, excluding proposals from Intersect and founding entities.\n\n2⃣ 1.5M ADA for Amaru Rust Node Development — a PRAGMA-led initiative to diversify Cardano nodes and enhance network resilience.\n\n3⃣ 50M ADA for DeFi Liquidity — aims to seed liquidity into DEXs and stablecoins, with yield partially returned to the treasury.\n\nAs SIPO DRep, we’re evaluating these developments based on:\n\n🔍 Cautious governance: supports the 200M ADA NCL.\n🚀 Growth & momentum: supports maintaining the 350M ADA cap.\n⚖️ Balanced compromise: 300M ADA could be a pragmatic middle ground.\n\nFor funding proposals, our assessment will focus on:\nDoes it generate a return to the treasury?\nIs transparency and execution capacity ensured?\nDoes it set a strong precedent for the first year of decentralized financial governance?\n\nThe NCL is more than just a number — it reflects Cardano’s financial philosophy and growth trajectory. Changing the cap directly impacts which proposals are viable.\n\nWe’ll soon publish SIPO’s evaluation criteria and vote logic for each major proposal. In the meantime, we welcome your input before the voting begins.\n\nIf you support our work as a DRep, please consider delegating:\n\nDRep ID:\ndrep1yffld2866p00cyg3ejjdewtvazgah7jjgk0s9m7m5ytmmdq33v3zh\n\nFor Daedalus:\ndrep120m237kstm7pzywv5nwtjm8gj8dl55j9nupwlkapz77mgv7zu7l"

This initiative is framed as a cautious initial step into fully on-chain treasury governance. The intended goal is to allow the Treasury to accumulate resources while the Cardano community develops and refines its processes for budgeting, funding allocation, and auditing. Proposers acknowledge that Treasury inflows in 2024 might have been around 350M ada but advocate for a lower NCL at the outset to mitigate risks associated with the community's relative inexperience in managing core developer payments and large-scale ecosystem funding. The plan is to gather insights from this initial period to inform a more experienced-based NCL for 2026. This conservative fiscal approach is contextualized by Cardano's broader strategic objectives, which include significant advancements in its technical infrastructure (such as the Leios upgrade, Hydra protocol, and Layer 2 scaling solutions), fostering ecosystem development to maintain competitiveness with other leading blockchain platforms, and maturing its decentralized governance model under the Voltaire era.",
        "myOpinion": "The proposal for a 200M ada NCL for the remainder of 2025 reflects a commendable desire for caution as Cardano transitions to more decentralized, on-chain treasury management. However, when weighed against Cardano's primary strategic objective—the continued evolution of its technical infrastructure, including critical initiatives like the Leios upgrade, Hydra protocol, and Layer 2 scaling solutions —and the explicit goal to 'pay a premium for good engineering', this NCL appears potentially too restrictive. Community feedback frequently highlights that funding requirements for core development (e.g., IOG) could consume a very large portion, if not most, of this 200M ada limit. This would leave minimal resources for other vital technical advancements from diverse ecosystem contributors, broader L2 scaling efforts, DeFi growth, and new project incubation—all essential for Cardano's long-term success and competitiveness. While prudence is essential, under-resourcing strategic technical priorities could hinder Cardano's trajectory more significantly than the risks associated with a slightly larger, yet still carefully managed, initial NCL. The consequences of implementing a 200M NCL might include slowed technical progress and a constrained ecosystem, potentially requiring reactive governance actions to adjust the limit upwards. Not implementing it (or having no NCL) would halt constitutional treasury withdrawals. Considering these factors, I **oppose** the 200M ada NCL proposal for the specified ~8-month period in 2025 as it may not adequately serve Cardano's strategic technical imperatives. A moderately higher NCL, perhaps in the 250M-275M ada range for this partial year, could offer a more balanced approach: still emphasizing fiscal caution and allowing governance processes to mature, but providing more realistic support for the critical technical evolution and ecosystem development that Cardano requires to achieve its long-term vision of becoming a leading blockchain platform. This should be coupled with rigorous, transparent, and milestone-driven budget approval and oversight mechanisms."

          "text": "🔥 #Cardano Governance Update 🔥\n\nWhat's at stake for the future of Cardano: The Update, The Constitution, the Treasury, and the Budgets.\n\nThe Plomin Hard Fork \n\nThis update will be the final step to full participation in Cardano Governance as designed by CIP-1694. Expect to see the Plomin Hard Fork submitted on chain very soon.  A few months ago, when the Chang Hard Fork was enacted, it activated the Governance Bootstrap Phase which allowed Delegated Representatives (DReps) to register on-chain and established the Constitutional Committee (CC) to vote on Governance Actions (GAs) along with Stake Pool Operators (SPOs).  However, governance was limited.\n\nOnce the Plomin Hard Fork passes the DReps will gain full voting power, not just the ability to vote on Info Actions (visit https://t.co/aRWErA7Waj for a guide to the different type of Governance Actions).  This means that the Cardano Community will be able to update the Cardano Constitution and withdraw funds from the Cardano Treasury.\n\nWhy do we care about establishing the Constitution and withdrawing funds from the Treasury?  Well, quite frankly, it's because Cardano has grown up and we have to start living on our own now.  When Cardano was launched in 2017 the pioneering entities were given grants of Ada (about 20% of the total supply) in order to deliver us a decentralized ecosystem that the we, the users, could govern ourselves.  Now that we have the power of governance we need to firmly set the ground rules that protects the rights of everyone who interacts in the Cardano ecosystem, we need to collectively decide on the future development roadmap of Cardano, and we need to have a way to pay for it!\n\nThe Constitution\n\nThe past few months have been a historic time for Cardano as the community engaged in a deliberative process to draft a new Constitution.  While an Interim Constitution had been established with the Chang Hard Fork that document was written with an intentional plan for replacement.  @IntersectMBO with the help of @InputOutputHK, @Cardano_CF, @emurgo_io, and countless community contributors held 63 workshops across the world where Delegates for a Constitutional Convention were selected. These Delegates participated in synthesis sessions to review the language of the proposed new constitution that had been drafted by the Cardano Civics Committee of Intersect, solicited community feedback on proposed changes, and then came together in Buenos Aires and Nairobi to debate and approve a final draft.\n\nAll that being said, this new Constitution is not yet approved!  In a decentralized ecosystem of blockchain technology like Cardano, the establishment of a new Constitution cannot be valid until the Ada holders, as represented by their DReps, vote in favor.  Once the Plomin Hard Fork has passed (fingers crossed!) the community will be able to consider a Governance Action to ratify the new Constitution.  We can continue to operate under the Interim Constitution, if we must, but it would be far preferable to move to a new Constitution that came from a community review process as soon as possible.\n\nThe Treasury\n\nOne of the most unique and powerful aspects of Cardano is that we have a common Treasury to provide for the operation, maintenance, and future development of the blockchain ecosystem. Each Epoch, 20% of the Rewards Pool (transaction fees and monetary expansion) goes to the Treasury instead while the rest goes to Staking Rewards.\n\nBecause this Treasury comes out of the Staking Rewards that would otherwise go to the members of the Cardano Community, it is essential that the fund be safeguarded.  That is why the Interim Constitution and the proposed Constitution both specify that a Net Change Limit must be approved through a Governance Info Action before any Treasury Withdrawals are made.\n\nThe Net Change Limit that is adopted by the community must define how much Ada can be spent out of the Treasury in a certain amount of time.  For practical purposes (at least as we start), this will most likely mean that we decide how much to spend in 73 epochs (a calendar year).  Because the CC is obligated to vote down any Treasury Withdrawal GA that does not fit within the established Net Change Limit, we must make sure that this value fits within our planned spending for the year and allows for contingencies that may come up.  There is a fine balance to be struck!\n\nThe Budgets\n\nIn addition to the Net Change Limit, the Interim Constitution and the proposed Constitution specify that the no Treasury Withdrawal GA can pass unless it fits within a Budget that has been approved by the Cardano community through a vote by DReps.  The CC must also vote on any proposed budget to ensure that proposed spending does not violate the Constitution.\n\nWith text of the Constitution, the Budget requirements are purposefully flexible to give the Cardano Community options to fund the decentralized ecosystem.  While the Interim Constitution simply says there must be some Budget in place, the proposed Constitution is a bit more explicit in describing how each Budget must have an Administrator to ensure Treasury Withdrawals are properly spent.  This Administrator could be a person, an institution, or a smart contract, and I expect we will see this practice evolve over time.\n\nWhile anyone on Cardano can propose a budget, a large amount of community effort has been focused on working with @IntersectMBO to propose a comprehensive budget to support Cardano in 2025.  This process is nearing completion and the Budget Committee has stated they will be ready to report their proposal to the community soon.  They have already held numerous community meetings describing the process and soliciting feedback.\n\nOne of the keys to Intersect's approach will be to ensure that there is no single person in charge of the administration of funds.  The Budgets that Intersect will propose will give Administrator responsibilities to various committees of Intersect that are run by Cardano community members.  Again, we are seeking to balance the benefits of decentralization with the recognition that empowering people to act for the greater good is the best way to move a process forward.\n\nThe Timeline & Conclusion\n\nNow that we have a clear picture on what needs to happen for Cardano to move forward, we can discuss the timing of each action. Each time a Governance Action is proposed the Cardano community has 6 Epochs (30 days) to vote on it and then it takes one Epoch for the GA to take effect.  While most actions can pass early (if they get the necessary threshold of Yes votes) it is best to make a conservative estimate that the vote will run the full length of time possible.\n\nIf the Plomin Hard Fork GA is submitted on December 21 (the beginning of Cardano Epoch 529) we are looking at probable enactment on January 24 (Epoch 536).  Then, and only then, can we reasonably submit the Constitution for ratification.  The Treasury will also be unlocked and DReps can consider Treasury Withdrawal Governance Actions.\n\nWhile the Treasury will be unlocked on January 24, provided that the Plomin Hard Fork GA passes, the CC will not approve any actions the DReps take to withdraw funds unless the Net Change Limit and at least one Budget have been approved.  That means that we will need to have the DReps and CC vote on Governance Info Actions to approve these items before any Treasury Withdrawals are submitted.\n\nFortunately, because DReps are able to vote for Info Actions right now, we do not need to wait for the Plomin Hard Fork to be enacted to begin these discussions.  The community can consider and vote on the Hard Fork, the Net Change Limit, and the proposed Budgets within the same window of time.  We have a lot of important issues to figure out but I am confident that we can work through them and show how decentralized governance can make a Top-10 Blockchain ecosystem not just function but thrive!\n\nIf you're a Blockchain Governance nerd like me, you've probably been nodding along as you read this and have been along for the ride up to this point.  If you're just getting into it and have read this far, I hope you'll join us for the next big step of the journey.  Either way, get some rest over the holidays, because January is going to be an exciting time for Cardano!",

          "originalText": "🔥 #Cardano Governance Update 🔥\n\nWhat's at stake for the future of Cardano: The Update, The Constitution, the Treasury, and the Budgets.\n\nThe Plomin Hard Fork \n\nThis update will be the final step to full participation in Cardano Governance as designed by CIP-1694. Expect to see the Plomin Hard Fork submitted on chain very soon.  A few months ago, when the Chang Hard Fork was enacted, it activated the Governance Bootstrap Phase which allowed Delegated Representatives (DReps) to register on-chain and established the Constitutional Committee (CC) to vote on Governance Actions (GAs) along with Stake Pool Operators (SPOs).  However, governance was limited.\n\nOnce the Plomin Hard Fork passes the DReps will gain full voting power, not just the ability to vote on Info Actions (visit https://t.co/aRWErA7Waj for a guide to the different type of Governance Actions).  This means that the Cardano Community will be able to update the Cardano Constitution and withdraw funds from the Cardano Treasury.\n\nWhy do we care about establishing the Constitution and withdrawing funds from the Treasury?  Well, quite frankly, it's because Cardano has grown up and we have to start living on our own now.  When Cardano was launched in 2017 the pioneering entities were given grants of Ada (about 20% of the total supply) in order to deliver us a decentralized ecosystem that the we, the users, could govern ourselves.  Now that we have the power of governance we need to firmly set the ground rules that protects the rights of everyone who interacts in the Cardano ecosystem, we need to collectively decide on the future development roadmap of Cardano, and we need to have a way to pay for it!\n\nThe Constitution\n\nThe past few months have been a historic time for Cardano as the community engaged in a deliberative process to draft a new Constitution.  While an Interim Constitution had been established with the Chang Hard Fork that document was written with an intentional plan for replacement.  @IntersectMBO with the help of @InputOutputHK, @Cardano_CF, @emurgo_io, and countless community contributors held 63 workshops across the world where Delegates for a Constitutional Convention were selected. These Delegates participated in synthesis sessions to review the language of the proposed new constitution that had been drafted by the Cardano Civics Committee of Intersect, solicited community feedback on proposed changes, and then came together in Buenos Aires and Nairobi to debate and approve a final draft.\n\nAll that being said, this new Constitution is not yet approved!  In a decentralized ecosystem of blockchain technology like Cardano, the establishment of a new Constitution cannot be valid until the Ada holders, as represented by their DReps, vote in favor.  Once the Plomin Hard Fork has passed (fingers crossed!) the community will be able to consider a Governance Action to ratify the new Constitution.  We can continue to operate under the Interim Constitution, if we must, but it would be far preferable to move to a new Constitution that came from a community review process as soon as possible.\n\nThe Treasury\n\nOne of the most unique and powerful aspects of Cardano is that we have a common Treasury to provide for the operation, maintenance, and future development of the blockchain ecosystem. Each Epoch, 20% of the Rewards Pool (transaction fees and monetary expansion) goes to the Treasury instead while the rest goes to Staking Rewards.\n\nBecause this Treasury comes out of the Staking Rewards that would otherwise go to the members of the Cardano Community, it is essential that the fund be safeguarded.  That is why the Interim Constitution and the proposed Constitution both specify that a Net Change Limit must be approved through a Governance Info Action before any Treasury Withdrawals are made.\n\nThe Net Change Limit that is adopted by the community must define how much Ada can be spent out of the Treasury in a certain amount of time.  For practical purposes (at least as we start), this will most likely mean that we decide how much to spend in 73 epochs (a calendar year).  Because the CC is obligated to vote down any Treasury Withdrawal GA that does not fit within the established Net Change Limit, we must make sure that this value fits within our planned spending for the year and allows for contingencies that may come up.  There is a fine balance to be struck!\n\nThe Budgets\n\nIn addition to the Net Change Limit, the Interim Constitution and the proposed Constitution specify that the no Treasury Withdrawal GA can pass unless it fits within a Budget that has been approved by the Cardano community through a vote by DReps.  The CC must also vote on any proposed budget to ensure that proposed spending does not violate the Constitution.\n\nWith text of the Constitution, the Budget requirements are purposefully flexible to give the Cardano Community options to fund the decentralized ecosystem.  While the Interim Constitution simply says there must be some Budget in place, the proposed Constitution is a bit more explicit in describing how each Budget must have an Administrator to ensure Treasury Withdrawals are properly spent.  This Administrator could be a person, an institution, or a smart contract, and I expect we will see this practice evolve over time.\n\nWhile anyone on Cardano can propose a budget, a large amount of community effort has been focused on working with @IntersectMBO to propose a comprehensive budget to support Cardano in 2025.  This process is nearing completion and the Budget Committee has stated they will be ready to report their proposal to the community soon.  They have already held numerous community meetings describing the process and soliciting feedback.\n\nOne of the keys to Intersect's approach will be to ensure that there is no single person in charge of the administration of funds.  The Budgets that Intersect will propose will give Administrator responsibilities to various committees of Intersect that are run by Cardano community members.  Again, we are seeking to balance the benefits of decentralization with the recognition that empowering people to act for the greater good is the best way to move a process forward.\n\nThe Timeline & Conclusion\n\nNow that we have a clear picture on what needs to happen for Cardano to move forward, we can discuss the timing of each action. Each time a Governance Action is proposed the Cardano community has 6 Epochs (30 days) to vote on it and then it takes one Epoch for the GA to take effect.  While most actions can pass early (if they get the necessary threshold of Yes votes) it is best to make a conservative estimate that the vote will run the full length of time possible.\n\nIf the Plomin Hard Fork GA is submitted on December 21 (the beginning of Cardano Epoch 529) we are looking at probable enactment on January 24 (Epoch 536).  Then, and only then, can we reasonably submit the Constitution for ratification.  The Treasury will also be unlocked and DReps can consider Treasury Withdrawal Governance Actions.\n\nWhile the Treasury will be unlocked on January 24, provided that the Plomin Hard Fork GA passes, the CC will not approve any actions the DReps take to withdraw funds unless the Net Change Limit and at least one Budget have been approved.  That means that we will need to have the DReps and CC vote on Governance Info Actions to approve these items before any Treasury Withdrawals are submitted.\n\nFortunately, because DReps are able to vote for Info Actions right now, we do not need to wait for the Plomin Hard Fork to be enacted to begin these discussions.  The community can consider and vote on the Hard Fork, the Net Change Limit, and the proposed Budgets within the same window of time.  We have a lot of important issues to figure out but I am confident that we can work through them and show how decentralized governance can make a Top-10 Blockchain ecosystem not just function but thrive!\n\nIf you're a Blockchain Governance nerd like me, you've probably been nodding along as you read this and have been along for the ride up to this point.  If you're just getting into it and have read this far, I hope you'll join us for the next big step of the journey.  Either way, get some rest over the holidays, because January is going to be an exciting time for Cardano!"

Different participants have shown that they may have different understandings of the meaning. Some do not understand it. Does NCL include inflows and/or outflows into the treasury? How is NCL calculated exactly? The precise definition is unclear. Voting YES until this is cleared up in the constitution could result in poorly understood actions leading to unexpected consequences. This could jeopardize the stability of the Cardano monetary system. Of course, this not the fault of the proposers of this governance action. Their governance action helped to uncover this lack of precision in the Cardano constitution.\n- The proposed governance action proposes setting the NCL close to the maximum projected inflows into the treasury. The maximum inflows are forecast to be 300M ADA in 2025 and 265M ADA in 2026. On the face of it, it is a relatively reasonable proposal to set the NCL to 300M ADA in 2025 and to 250M ADA in 2026.\n- I do not think there is a need to set the NCL for 2026 at this moment in time.

This will help focus the budgetary discussion on essentials.\n- I also have to consider that Catalyst has been allocated 150M ADA for three funds in 2024. Not all of this has been disbursed as the Catalyst payments are milestone based and some Catalyst projects give up or just stall. Many payments still take place in 2025. The proposed NCL for 2025 of 300M ADA is twice the size of what was allocated to Catalyst in 2024.\n- I also agree with suggestions that I think the Net Change Limit (NCL) could be linked to or calculated based on net treasury revenue for the previous 73 epochs.  This was proposed by Cardano DRep CardanoYoda: \"If the NCL is set to, for example, 80% and Treasury revenue for the last year was 300M ADA, 240M ADA could be spent.\" The advantages of this solution are that it is not necessary to project future Treasury revenue. A similar idea was floated by Cardano community member Max Capacity in the TECH SPO Discord: \" Monte Carlo simulations for estimating forward value? There's just so much variability and it opens it up to second guessing and even more wasted time and energy.

          "text": "Let me explain the Net Change Limit in context.\n\nThe Net Change Limit (NCL) serves as a prevention against excessive withdrawal of ADA from the Treasury.\n\nThe NCL defines the maximum amount of ADA that can be withdrawn from the Treasury in a given period. This period is usually one year, which corresponds to 72 epochs.\n\nThe NCL can be defined as the amount of ADA for a given period. An alternative approach would be to express it as a percentage of Treasury revenue for a given past period.\n\nFor example, as 80% of Treasury revenue for the last 72 epochs.\n\nIt is up to the community to choose what they like best. \n\nThe first approach is more flexible because it is necessary to approve the NCL every year. The second approach could work in the long term without annual approval.\n\nThe NCL must be approved through governance action before it is possible to submit a proposal for withdrawal of ADA from the Treasury.\n\nThe NCL applies to all withdrawals from the Treasury in a given period.\n\nOnce the total number of ADA individually withdrawn from the Treasury reaches the defined NCL, further withdrawals exceeding the limit will become unconstitutional.\n\nThere is currently no NCL defined, so withdrawals are not possible.\n\nThere are two governance actions regarding NCL for next year.\n\nThe first one submitted by the community tries to set the NCL at 300M ADA. The second one from intersect sets 350M ADA.\n\nThere are currently 1.71B ADA in the Cardano Treasury.\n\nRevenues to the treasury consist of monetary expansion and fees. Fees are currently almost negligible. \n\nMost of the revenues consist of monetary expansion, i.e. the gradual transfer of ADA from the reserve to the Treasury.\n\nThere are currently 7.2B ADA in the reserve. The reserve is used to pay out staking rewards and deposit ADA into the Treasury.\n\nThe reserve is gradually trending towards 0. With each subsequent epoch, the reserve is decreasing. \n\nTreasury revenues will depend on fees and possibly other alternative revenues in the future.\n\nNCL is to prevent the rapid depletion of the Treasury, as ADA should be used to grow the ecosystem. \n\nBy this you can imagine a payment to IOG for the delivery of Ouroboros Leios, but also, for example, minting stablecoins.

          "originalText": "Let me explain the Net Change Limit in context.\n\nThe Net Change Limit (NCL) serves as a prevention against excessive withdrawal of ADA from the Treasury.\n\nThe NCL defines the maximum amount of ADA that can be withdrawn from the Treasury in a given period. This period is usually one year, which corresponds to 72 epochs.\n\nThe NCL can be defined as the amount of ADA for a given period. An alternative approach would be to express it as a percentage of Treasury revenue for a given past period.\n\nFor example, as 80% of Treasury revenue for the last 72 epochs.\n\nIt is up to the community to choose what they like best. \n\nThe first approach is more flexible because it is necessary to approve the NCL every year. The second approach could work in the long term without annual approval.\n\nThe NCL must be approved through governance action before it is possible to submit a proposal for withdrawal of ADA from the Treasury.\n\nThe NCL applies to all withdrawals from the Treasury in a given period.\n\nOnce the total number of ADA individually withdrawn from the Treasury reaches the defined NCL, further withdrawals exceeding the limit will become unconstitutional.\n\nThere is currently no NCL defined, so withdrawals are not possible.\n\nThere are two governance actions regarding NCL for next year.\n\nThe first one submitted by the community tries to set the NCL at 300M ADA. The second one from intersect sets 350M ADA.\n\nThere are currently 1.71B ADA in the Cardano Treasury.\n\nRevenues to the treasury consist of monetary expansion and fees. Fees are currently almost negligible. \n\nMost of the revenues consist of monetary expansion, i.e. the gradual transfer of ADA from the reserve to the Treasury.\n\nThere are currently 7.2B ADA in the reserve. The reserve is used to pay out staking rewards and deposit ADA into the Treasury.\n\nThe reserve is gradually trending towards 0. With each subsequent epoch, the reserve is decreasing. \n\nTreasury revenues will depend on fees and possibly other alternative revenues in the future.\n\nNCL is to prevent the rapid depletion of the Treasury, as ADA should be used to grow the ecosystem. \n\nBy this you can imagine a payment to IOG for the delivery of Ouroboros Leios, but also, for example, minting stablecoins. Basically, anything that the community approves.\n\nThere is a consensus that expenses should not be higher than Treasury revenues. NCL should reflect this. However, it is theoretically possible to approve NCL higher than Treasury revenues.\n\nAn important aspect of NCL is the direct negative impact on the market price of ADA. Entities that receive ADA from the Treasury can sell coins on the market to cover their living expenses.\n\nSelling pressure can harm SPOs and stakers.\n\nUltimately, this can also have a negative impact on Treasury, because if the market price of ADA is low in a bear market, it will be necessary to sell even more ADA in the coming years.\n\nIt is necessary to find a balance between the potential long-term positive impact of the investment and the medium-term market price of ADA.\n\nNCL does not mean that we have to spend a defined maximum. It is possible to approve an NCL of 350M ADA, but still, only 200M ADA can be approved in total spending in a given period.\n\nNCL is only an insurance against exceeding the limit. \n\nMore important are individual withdrawals.

The proposers have stated that from January 5th, 2024, Epoch 459, through December 30th, Epoch 531, the actual total income into the Cardano Treasury was 335,957,093 ada.\n\nThe proposed NCL is 350M ada. This is roughly 14M ada higher than the total income in the Cardano Treasury for 2024. I welcome the proposed reference to modelling and the reference to a previous period for which we have data. \n\nThe motion uses modelling of ADA inflow for the previous year as the main basis for approving an NCL. It is indeed one of the factors that must be considered.\n \nWhat I am missing in this proposal - as it proposes a relatively large NCL - is even a minor economic analysis of how approvals of different NCLs could impact the valuation of ADA. An NCL of 350M ADA is sending a signal to the market. What is this signal? \n\nHow does it compare to previous signals? If we do not have the data, is there room for a prediction at least?\nWith the lack of this economic/monetary analysis, we are left to speculate. My feeling is that NCL approvals in the future will become defining moments that shape the ADA exchange rate vs the USD. It is a signal how much ADA could be released - a signal approved by the majority of DReps. \n\nThe approval of a large NCL could have an immediate price impact on the value of ADA, thus diminishing the purchase power of the 350M ADA. Before the budget elements are approved. \n\nAfter approving a large NCL, the budgetary discussions will probably take place in the shadow of a lower ADA/USD exchange rate. Thus we might be forced by the market to push an annual budget towards the top limit of the NCL. We could create a self-fulfilling prophesy. \n\nThe problem I see with a very large first year NCL is that our budgetary and governance processes are the weakest and most inefficient in the first year. Our ability to audit, prevent waste and abuse are questionable. A lower NCL would focus minds.\n\nWithout a monetary/economic analysis or forecast, I would consider voting for a NCL in the 200-250M ADA in 2025 (depending on the text of the NCL proposal) as it would give a better signal to the market about our intentions to balance the development of the system and the intention to safeguard the value of ADA and Cardano's Top 10 position. Especially, as our abilities to manage the potential spending of so much ADA in the early days of decentralized governance are the lowest. \n\nI see this conservative approach as something that protects the interests of ADA holders and stakers. \n\nBest practice: We SHOULD approve the closest NCL to the actual budget that we want as DReps. By approving a much larger NCL we will be devaluing the ada currency BEFORE any budget is approved and before the contractors receive the ADA. Effectively crippling ourselves unnecessarily. \n\nIf the intention is to approve a lower budget than 350M ada as some (many?) DReps seem to have indicated, then to preserve the value of that ada for those who will receive it, the best thing we can do is to vote for an NCL that is closest to that intended 2025 budget total.",

Submitted budgets have not reasonably proven this amount of ADA is necessary, so I cannot in good conscience approve this level of spending.\n\nI am willing to approve a NCL of ~200 Million ADA, and will do so if a GA is submitted to support this.\n\nIf we had community pooled GA supported tooling from @IntersectMBO  / https://t.co/FPs8Wq7glV / @InputOutputHK  this would be a non-issue, as average Cardano community members would have been able to submit their own GAs and this would be done already.\n\nI'm disappointed that this necessary tooling has been withheld and was promised as part of a compromise for a 100 Million ADA deposit for GAs.\n\nI appreciate that @danogo_2023 is developing pooled ADA support for GAs at their own expense for the Cardano community ❤️"

          "text": "Questions for those voting NO on NCL = 350M ADA.\n\nI respect the decision of those who vote NO and understand the rationale behind it. \n\nHowever, I believe it's worth carefully examining the potential consequences of such a stance—or at the very least, identifying if I’m overlooking something critical.\n\n• Scalability and Funding: What is your alternative plan for ensuring the scalability of Cardano? Without the approved NCL, how do you expect teams like IOG or Midgard to cover ongoing development costs? Are you not concerned that this might slow down or even stall progress?\n\n• Catalyst Funding: The next Catalyst round is on hold, awaiting a budget decision. Essential ecosystem teams are already at risk of fighting for survival. Is that an acceptable trade-off?\n\n• Flexibility of Governance: Are you aware that a new Governance Action (GA) proposing a lower NCL can be submitted at any time? If so, why is NCL = 350M ADA perceived as so threatening?\n\n• Market Timing and Investment Windows: The current bull market won’t last forever. Now is the ideal time to mint stablecoins, run marketing campaigns, and support strategic initiatives. By the end of 2025, it may be too late. Isn’t it prudent to act while conditions are favorable?\n\n• Checks and Balances: Why assume total spending will automatically reach the NCL cap? DReps are tasked with voting on the budget and treasury withdrawals. ADA holders can monitor their choices and redelegate if necessary. Isn’t this an effective safeguard?\n\n• Misuse Isn’t Solved by NCL Alone: Even under a lower NCL, poorly designed or fraudulent projects may still get approved. Isn’t it more productive to focus on improving the quality of Budget Proposals rather than capping available funds?\n\n• Selling Pressure and Timing: Teams would receive a higher USD value if they sell ADA near an all-time high. While that scenario may still play out, the crypto market is notoriously unpredictable. Spreading withdrawals over time reduces sell pressure. Does it really make sense to delay spending until the end of 2025?\n\nI welcome constructive dialogue. My intent is not to polarize but to ensure that all dimensions of this decision are fully considered.",

          "originalText": "Questions for those voting NO on NCL = 350M ADA.\n\nI respect the decision of those who vote NO and understand the rationale behind it. \n\nHowever, I believe it's worth carefully examining the potential consequences of such a stance—or at the very least, identifying if I’m overlooking something critical.\n\n• Scalability and Funding: What is your alternative plan for ensuring the scalability of Cardano? Without the approved NCL, how do you expect teams like IOG or Midgard to cover ongoing development costs? Are you not concerned that this might slow down or even stall progress?\n\n• Catalyst Funding: The next Catalyst round is on hold, awaiting a budget decision. Essential ecosystem teams are already at risk of fighting for survival. Is that an acceptable trade-off?\n\n• Flexibility of Governance: Are you aware that a new Governance Action (GA) proposing a lower NCL can be submitted at any time? If so, why is NCL = 350M ADA perceived as so threatening?\n\n• Market Timing and Investment Windows: The current bull market won’t last forever. Now is the ideal time to mint stablecoins, run marketing campaigns, and support strategic initiatives. By the end of 2025, it may be too late. Isn’t it prudent to act while conditions are favorable?\n\n• Checks and Balances: Why assume total spending will automatically reach the NCL cap? DReps are tasked with voting on the budget and treasury withdrawals. ADA holders can monitor their choices and redelegate if necessary. Isn’t this an effective safeguard?\n\n• Misuse Isn’t Solved by NCL Alone: Even under a lower NCL, poorly designed or fraudulent projects may still get approved. Isn’t it more productive to focus on improving the quality of Budget Proposals rather than capping available funds?\n\n• Selling Pressure and Timing: Teams would receive a higher USD value if they sell ADA near an all-time high. While that scenario may still play out, the crypto market is notoriously unpredictable. Spreading withdrawals over time reduces sell pressure. Does it really make sense to delay spending until the end of 2025?\n\nI welcome constructive dialogue. My intent is not to polarize but to ensure that all dimensions of this decision are fully considered."

Last I checked both Midgard and IOG teams are still making good progress on things, despite the fact that we have not withdrawn from the Cardano treasury in a very long time.  I don't think another 6 weeks while we pursue a better will slow progress meaningfully.\n\nCatalyst Funding - I'm not aware of these ecosystem teams that are \"fighting for survival\".  Catalyst has already been funded up through F13.  And how would any of these projects know that they would be approved for funding anyways?  IMHO a 6-week delay is perfectly fine.\n\nFlexibility of Governance - I'm aware that a new NCL can be passed that is lower.  However, I worry that once we have a high NCL passed, many of the top dReps who happen to have budget proposals will rigorously defend the high limit so that their proposals have a better chance.  Better to approve a low NCL and then raise it later if we have to IMHO.\n\nMarket Timing and Investment Windows - I don't think any of the budget proposals mentioned so far move the needle enough in a positive direction to be worth the ADA they are asking for.  What is the PMF we are trying to market?  What strategic initiatives other than ones in IOG's core proposal, Midgard, Starstream, Amaru, and Gerolamo are needed?  All of those combined are still less than 200M ADA.  Also, I support a stablecoin liquidity proposal, but it needs to be decoupled from Emurgo's omnibus proposal IMHO.\n\nChecks and Balances - The issue here is not necessarily that dReps will want to spend up to the cap.  It's that budget proposers will.  We don't have enough visibility into ANY of the proposals' true costs.  Example:  Maybe with a 150M NCL, IOG might propose 50M for their core proposal.  With 350M NCL, there is enough room for them to ask for 100M first just to see if it passes.  We WANT budget proposers to be *LIMITED* by the NCL to get them to compete to lower costs.\n\nMisuse Isn’t Solved by NCL Alone - Agreed.  But IMHO lowering the NCL will cause proposers to increase the *quality* of their proposals in order to compete with other proposers for a slice of a smaller pie.\n\nSelling Pressure and Timing - ADA is currently 5x below ATH.  I very much doubt that it will be on its way back down again 6 weeks from now.  In fact I think if we delay a little bit we'll be more likely to stretch the value of our ADA spent to go much further.\n\nThese are some of the main reasons I am strongly against approving a 350M NCL right now.",

We need an NCL. Voting on this Info Action is open right now: https://t.co/y2QhpF7s30\n\nAdditional thoughts:\n\n- Approving this limit is the shortest path to getting builders funded in the Cardano ecosystem. If we propose an arbitrarily smaller NCL info action, it will need to go through approval and will delay this process by another month. \n\n- This NCL creates a cap of what we can possibly spend in the coming year. This does not mean we are approving a ₳350M withdrawal (or any withdrawal at this time) from the Cardano Treasury.\n\n- This Info Action already has 50%+ approval from the DReps, and its approval allows us to start the process of funding projects building on Cardano.\n\n-  This net change limit value is about equivalent to the income of the Cardano Treasury in the past year. From January 5th, 2024, Epoch 459, through December 30th, Epoch 531, the actual total income into the Cardano Treasury was 335,957,093 ada. So this NCL essentially states that we will not spend more than what we made last year. I think that’s a pretty reasonable statement.\n\n- Just as easily as we are having a vote now, we can vote to revise the NCL in 2026. I would expect that the DReps will vote to adjust the NCL appropriately over time to ensure sustainable deployment of the Cardano Treasury. \n\n- There is a balance between ‘spending and being wasteful’ versus ‘not spending and constraining the ecosystem.’ This NCL puts a reasonable guardrail on those discussions.",

          "originalText": "I encourage all Cardano DReps that have not voted yet to go to GovTool and vote ‘Yes’ on the Info Action that enables the ₳350M net change limit (NCL) for the Cardano Treasury. \n\nI am in favor of a ₳350M net change limit. We need an NCL. Voting on this Info Action is open right now: https://t.co/y2QhpF7s30\n\nAdditional thoughts:\n\n- Approving this limit is the shortest path to getting builders funded in the Cardano ecosystem. If we propose an arbitrarily smaller NCL info action, it will need to go through approval and will delay this process by another month. \n\n- This NCL creates a cap of what we can possibly spend in the coming year. This does not mean we are approving a ₳350M withdrawal (or any withdrawal at this time) from the Cardano Treasury.\n\n- This Info Action already has 50%+ approval from the DReps, and its approval allows us to start the process of funding projects building on Cardano.\n\n-  This net change limit value is about equivalent to the income of the Cardano Treasury in the past year. From January 5th, 2024, Epoch 459, through December 30th, Epoch 531, the actual total income into the Cardano Treasury was 335,957,093 ada. So this NCL essentially states that we will not spend more than what we made last year. I think that’s a pretty reasonable statement.\n\n- Just as easily as we are having a vote now, we can vote to revise the NCL in 2026. I would expect that the DReps will vote to adjust the NCL appropriately over time to ensure sustainable deployment of the Cardano Treasury. \n\n- There is a balance between ‘spending and being wasteful’ versus ‘not spending and constraining the ecosystem.’ This NCL puts a reasonable guardrail on those discussions."

          "text": "I voted NO ⛔️to reduce the Net Change Limit (NCL) to 200M ADA, which has been one of the toughest governance decisions so far. \n\nIt feels like there’s no entirely good option here.\n\nMoreover, I myself called for a lower NCL.\n\nThe current NCL of 350M ADA has some notable drawbacks.\n\nIf high selling pressure causes ADA’s price to drop significantly, say to 0.2 USD, it could result in serious challenges. \n\nFunding the ecosystem in dollar terms would require selling a large amount of ADA from the treasury, leading to a spiral of selling pressure that could worsen the situation.\n\nCardano Whale (@cardano_whale) pointed out that some projects like Tezos and Polkadot have invested heavily in their ecosystems, possess innovative technologies, yet struggle to gain substantial attention.\n\nI fully agree with that.\n\nFor blockchains, maintaining a presence in the top 10 market capitalization rankings is vital.\n\nRetail investors, institutions, and crypto enthusiasts evaluate projects not only based on technology but also on market performance. \n\nIf Cardano drops out of the top 10 for an extended period, it may never regain its position, regardless of decentralization or technological progress like Ouroboros Leios. \n\nThis is an important factor to consider, even if it feels unfair or subjective.\n\nOn the other hand, reducing the NCL to 200M ADA comes with its own set of concerns.\n\nCardano needs investments to advance its technology, support builders, and develop the ecosystem. Without increased user activity, Treasury revenue won't grow. \n\nSpending on maintenance and development in the next years risks exhausting the reserve, ultimately making Cardano economically unsustainable.\n\nProtocol security also hinges on attractive staking rewards and incentives. Moreover, Ouroboros Leios’s potential will remain untapped without active developers, tools, and a growing DeFi ecosystem. Investments in all these areas are crucial.\n\nIOG has made their funding requirements clear: Core Dev needs 96M ADA, Catalyst 69M ADA, and Research 27M ADA. Combined, this totals 192M ADA. The offer from IOG is simple: either approve this funding or let it be.\n\nDebates around fairness, IOG and Charles’s past contributions, and the definition of “completion” for Cardano have their place, but the reality is that IOG holds unmatched expertise in the protocol. No other entity can effectively take over maintenance, development, and research at the same pace or quality.\n\nIf DReps allocate 192M ADA to IOG, only 8M ADA remains for other projects.\n\nAfter reviewing budget proposals, I supported only the essentials I believe the ecosystem absolutely needs: projects like Midgard, Starstream, Hydra, ZK Rollups, Blockfrost, Lucid, Chainlink integration, and others. \n\nFor the CORE category alone, this amounts to around 12M ADA. Across all categories, my total approved budget comes to 213M ADA.\n\nGiven my own estimate of required expenditures is 213M ADA, I cannot support an NCL of 200M ADA. \n\nIt would contradict my stance on necessary project funding versus the cap I approve. This inconsistency guided my decision to vote NO on reducing the NCL.\n\nCardano requires effective marketing and improved governance support, as the current situation is far from ideal.\n\nInvesting in the ecosystem and advancing new technologies must go hand in hand to ensure sustainable growth.\n\nApproving the NCL of 200M ADA, in my view, would mean preserving the status quo, leaving all key responsibilities to IOG while neglecting investment in the broader ecosystem. \n\nEssentially, it would restrict funding for entities that are vital to the ecosystem, just as IOG is.\n\nAn important consideration is the expected scenarios surrounding the NCL.\n\nBoth NCLs, an NCL of 350M ADA and 200M ADA, are extremes in my view.\n\nThe current NCL, set at 350M ADA, has strong support with 76% of the voting stake participating. Nearly the entire voting stake approved it. Drastically reducing the NCL from 350M to 200M ADA would be either irresponsible or overly ambitious.\n\nWhat would happen next? Builders, Intersect, IOG, or others would likely submit a new governance action proposing an intermediate NCL, perhaps 250M or 300M ADA. Alternatively, multiple proposals could be submitted simultaneously.\n\nThis scenario would create an unstable environment that is counterproductive and difficult to support. Such instability undermines progress.\n\nMoreover, the crypto community has little interest in prolonged debates about how much the Cardano ecosystem can afford to invest.\n\nIn an unstable environment, even proposing a coherent budget becomes nearly impossible.\n\nCurrently, we have an NCL of 350M ADA. Consider this likely scenario:\n\nIntersect is expected to submit a governance action for the budget expiring in June. Meanwhile, if a new NCL of 200M ADA is approved by the end of May, the proposed budget would effectively become unconstitutional unless it is approved before the new NCL takes effect. \n\nThis complicates the process and further highlights the issues with sudden, extreme changes.\n\nDebating the NCL through governance actions is both inefficient and overly time-consuming.\n\nIt seems likely that the community's consensus would fall somewhere between 250M–300M ADA. However, no off-chain temperature check was conducted (to which the majority of the community would respond) before the on-chain vote, which led to the current NCL being approved simply to allow the budgeting process to continue.\n\nThe concept of the NCL itself is starting to feel unnecessary, as it constantly shifts based on the majority vote. If the voting stake agrees to increase or decrease the NCL, it will inevitably happen.\n\nIt’s important to emphasize that the NCL doesn’t dictate the amount that must be spent from the treasury. Every withdrawal proposal still requires approval from the community.\n\nI would likely vote YES if the current proposal fell within the 250M–300M ADA range. If a proposal like this is submitted, I would support it, as it aligns with the budget I consider reasonable based on the proposals I have endorsed.\n\nHowever, my decision isn’t final and may change depending on future developments in governance. \n\nFor instance, if governance actions combine multiple proposals that result in an excessively high total cost, or if the IOG proposal is grouped with several proposals I don’t support, or one I strongly oppose, such as the Daedalus 2025 Service Enhancement, I might reconsider my stance.\n\nIf the only way to prevent a poor budget outcome is to vote for a lower NCL, I am prepared to do so. This decision is nuanced and cannot be seen in black-and-white terms.\n\nI want to avoid a scenario where approving a lower NCL inevitably results in another GA submission. Addressing the NCL repeatedly is time-consuming and unproductive. \n\nDReps need to prioritize budget proposals instead.\n\nA higher NCL serves no purpose if it ends up funding low-quality projects within the budget.\n\nMy DRep ID:\ndrep1km69g7ksf8t5g0h9d9tkrcd2tezxelx0wtr76rv2mrkl5nzd6v3",

      "title": "Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Budget - 275M ada Administered by Intersect",
      "abstract": "On behalf of Intersect and the Cardano Budget Committee, this Budget Info Action proposes a Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Budget of 275,269,340 ada. The period during which this Budget Info Action remains in effect will begin at the close of its voting period and continue for 73 epochs (52 weeks). This budget is an aggregate allocation and following Treasury Withdrawal(s) must be in compliance with an approved and active Net Change Limit, among other conditions. This budget comprises 39 proposals that support maintenance, development, marketing, innovation, and governance initiatives within the Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem.\n\nTo arrive at this budget, Intersect facilitated a community budget submission process, using live DRep stake to assess and validate support through the Ekklesia platform. More than 3.8B ada in voting stake participated, representing over 70% of actively delegated stake (excluding pre-defined voting options). A total of 194 proposals were submitted as part of Intersect’s coordination efforts for budget socialization. Projects that received over 50% support by stake from participating DReps, and named Intersect as their Administrator, have been included in this Budget Info Action. Of the 194 proposals submitted, 40 met the required support threshold, and 39 of these named Intersect as their Administrator. Any proposals that proceeded directly on-chain outside of this Budget Info Action have been excluded from ours.\n\nAll proposals listed below have requested Intersect as their Administrator, who will oversee and administer the use of funds from Cardano Blockchain Treasury withdrawals in accordance with this budget and the requirements of the Cardano Constitution. This includes leveraging blockchain technology such as smart contracts as per Article IV, Section 2 in the Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Constitution. Intersect, in our role as an Administrator for the included proposals in this aggregate budget, will - wherever possible and available - utilize a smart contract framework to oversee disbursements including a multi-signature oversight body made up of organizations and auditors, one of which will be Intersect in our role as Administrator.",
      "content": "This rationale underpins the Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Budget Info Action - an aggregate allocation of 275,269,340 ada across 39 proposals that each won >50% of participating DRep stake (3.8B ada in live stake >70% of actively delegated stake excluding pre-defined voting options).\n\n**Proposal Intake & Consolidation**\n\nBetween 1 April  – 5 May 2025, the Cardano Budget Committee at Intersect accepted funding requests through two streams:\n\n- Committee “block budgets” connected to several Intersect committees (product, open source, governance, marketing, research) aligned to the vision and product roadmap.\n- Open community submissions from any Cardano contributor, regardless of Intersect membership.\n\nAll 194 submissions followed a standard template (problem, benefits, roadmap alignment, cost) and could be refined with committee feedback, capturing both top-down strategy and bottom-up innovation before DRep review.\n\n**Community Signalling**\n\nDReps and ada holders expressed their preferences in two rounds of off-chain polling: an initial GovTool survey and a final Ekklesia “temperature-check” poll that closed at 23:59 UTC on 5 May 2025. Proposals that garnered over 50% of the participating DRep stake and selected Intersect as their Administrator advanced to this Budget Info Action. The poll artefacts are publicly available (see references below). All proposal content was timestamped at the close of the temperature-check poll and now published to IPFS as part of this on-chain submission, creating an immutable record.\n\n**On-Chain Approval & Oversight**\n\n**Budget Info Action & Net Change Limit**\n\nThe 39 qualifying proposals have been bundled into this single Budget Info Action for DRep ratification. While the total requested funding sits below the Net Change Limit (NCL) currently in force, 350 trillion lovelace, or 350 million ada, as of 8 May 2025, the NCL itself can be amended by a separate Info Action at any time. Consequently, each subsequent Treasury Withdrawal must be presented and approved only if it remains within the then-active NCL, in line with Article IV of the Cardano Constitution and Guardrail: TREASURY-02a.\n\nAlthough all included proposals have requested Intersect as their Administrator, this designation is not automatically guaranteed. Ahead of any Treasury Withdrawal governance action, proposers will be required to undergo due diligence, including KYC/KYB and other background and verification checks. Intersect reserves the right to decline or withdraw its role as Administrator if a proposal fails to meet these requirements, and remains at its discretion.\n\n**Treasury Withdrawal & Fund Management**\n\nOnce ratified, Intersect - named as the Administrator in every proposal included in this budget allocation - will submit Treasury Withdrawal governance action(s) for DReps to approve the release of funds from the Cardano Treasury. Safeguards include:\n\n- Wherever possible and applicable, multi-sig controlled smart-contract decentralized escrow with signers from Intersect, independent auditors, and other appointed bodies. Being developed by Sundae Labs.\n- Disbursements from smart contracts or related accounts will be executed in line with the proposal’s contractual terms and subject to regular oversight, reporting, and - where applicable - milestone acceptance.

          "abstract": "On behalf of Intersect and the Cardano Budget Committee, this Budget Info Action proposes a Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Budget of 275,269,340 ada. The period during which this Budget Info Action remains in effect will begin at the close of its voting period and continue for 73 epochs (52 weeks). This budget is an aggregate allocation and following Treasury Withdrawal(s) must be in compliance with an approved and active Net Change Limit, among other conditions. This budget comprises 39 proposals that support maintenance, development, marketing, innovation, and governance initiatives within the Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem.\n\nTo arrive at this budget, Intersect facilitated a community budget submission process, using live DRep stake to assess and validate support through the Ekklesia platform. More than 3.8B ada in voting stake participated, representing over 70% of actively delegated stake (excluding pre-defined voting options). A total of 194 proposals were submitted as part of Intersect’s coordination efforts for budget socialization. Projects that received over 50% support by stake from participating DReps, and named Intersect as their Administrator, have been included in this Budget Info Action. Of the 194 proposals submitted, 40 met the required support threshold, and 39 of these named Intersect as their Administrator. Any proposals that proceeded directly on-chain outside of this Budget Info Action have been excluded from ours.\n\nAll proposals listed below have requested Intersect as their Administrator, who will oversee and administer the use of funds from Cardano Blockchain Treasury withdrawals in accordance with this budget and the requirements of the Cardano Constitution. This includes leveraging blockchain technology such as smart contracts as per Article IV, Section 2 in the Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Constitution. Intersect, in our role as an Administrator for the included proposals in this aggregate budget, will - wherever possible and available - utilize a smart contract framework to oversee disbursements including a multi-signature oversight body made up of organizations and auditors, one of which will be Intersect in our role as Administrator.",

Proposals that garnered over 50% of the participating DRep stake and selected Intersect as their Administrator advanced to this Budget Info Action. The poll artefacts are publicly available (see references below).

While the total requested funding sits below the Net Change Limit (NCL) currently in force, 350 trillion lovelace, or 350 million ada, as of 8 May 2025, the NCL itself can be amended by a separate Info Action at any time. Consequently, each subsequent Treasury Withdrawal must be presented and approved only if it remains within the then-active NCL, in line with Article IV of the Cardano Constitution and Guardrail: TREASURY-02a.\n\nAlthough all included proposals have requested Intersect as their Administrator, this designation is not automatically guaranteed. Ahead of any Treasury Withdrawal governance action, proposers will be required to undergo due diligence, including KYC/KYB and other background and verification checks. Intersect reserves the right to decline or withdraw its role as Administrator if a proposal fails to meet these requirements, and remains at its discretion.\n\n**Treasury Withdrawal & Fund Management**\n\nOnce ratified, Intersect - named as the Administrator in every proposal included in this budget allocation - will submit Treasury Withdrawal governance action(s) for DReps to approve the release of funds from the Cardano Treasury. Safeguards include:\n\n- Wherever possible and applicable, multi-sig controlled smart-contract decentralized escrow with signers from Intersect, independent auditors, and other appointed bodies. Being developed by Sundae Labs.\n- Disbursements from smart contracts or related accounts will be executed in line with the proposal’s contractual terms and subject to regular oversight, reporting, and - where applicable - milestone acceptance.

This initiative, administered by Intersect, emerged from a community signaling process via Ekklesia and requires DRep ratification and compliance with the Net Change Limit (NCL). The proposal's background is Cardano's strategic need to enhance its technical infrastructure (like Leios, Hydra, and Layer 2 solutions), improve ecosystem development (DeFi, NFTs, tooling), and evolve its decentralized governance mechanisms to remain competitive and sustainable. The intended goal is to provide substantial, structured funding to a diverse range of projects deemed critical by a segment of the DRep community, with Intersect ensuring oversight and fund management through mechanisms like smart contracts.",
        "myOpinion": "Considering Cardano's strategic imperative to advance its technical infrastructure (Hydra, Leios, Layer 2 solutions)  and cultivate a thriving, competitive ecosystem, a significant, coordinated funding initiative is undeniably necessary. This proposal aims to address this by operationalizing community-signaled preferences for 39 projects, with Intersect fulfilling the constitutionally mandated administrative role.\n\nHowever, the proposed mechanism – a single, bundled 275 million ADA vote for 39 diverse proposals – presents serious governance and strategic risks. This 'all-or-nothing' approach  severely limits granular DRep oversight, potentially leading to the funding of lower-priority projects alongside critical ones and hindering efficient capital allocation. This is particularly concerning when Cardano's strategy emphasizes the need to 'pay a premium for good engineering'  and focus on core technical advancements. The procedural concerns raised by the community regarding DRep consultation, voting transparency, and threshold calculations during the Ekklesia process also undermine the legitimacy of this aggregated action.\n\nWhile not implementing this specific bundled proposal might cause short-term delays in funding, it offers a crucial opportunity to refine the process towards greater DRep empowerment, transparency, and strategic alignment. The potential negative impacts of misallocating such a substantial sum – including ADA devaluation  and damage to community trust – outweigh the benefits of expediency in this instance.\n\nTherefore, I **oppose** this proposal in its current bundled format.\n\nMy reasoning is grounded in the following principles:\n1.  **Strategic Alignment & Efficiency**: A bundled vote for 39 disparate projects makes it difficult to ensure that funds are primarily directed towards Cardano's core technical objectives, such as Leios, Hydra, and L2 scaling solutions. A more granular approach would allow for better alignment and ensure that resources are concentrated where they can yield the highest long-term strategic value.\n2.  **DRep Accountability & Granular Oversight**: The bundled approach diminishes the DReps' ability to make discerning judgments on individual proposals, which is fundamental to robust decentralized governance.\n3.  **Transparency & Legitimacy**: The procedural ambiguities and lack of DRep consultation highlighted by the community  must be addressed to ensure the long-term health and legitimacy of Cardano's governance processes.\n4.  **Long-term Sustainability**: While immediate funding is important, establishing sound, transparent, and accountable funding mechanisms is more critical for Cardano's strategic sustainability. Accepting a flawed process for such a large sum sets a poor precedent.\n\nA preferable path would involve unbundling the proposals into smaller, thematically coherent packages, or allowing individual proposal ratification, coupled with a clear resolution of the procedural concerns. This would foster greater DRep engagement, ensure more targeted funding aligned with Cardano's strategic technical priorities, and build stronger community trust in the governance system, even if it requires more time initially."

          "text": "A few observations about the Cardano budget.\n\nI am pleased with the total budget of 266.7M ADA. I expect revenue to be higher (about 320M ADA), so we will likely save ADA for the next few years.\n\nBeing in a bull market, it is advantageous to invest more for several reasons. \n\nAs the market price of ADA increases, getting a higher dollar value with a smaller amount of ADA coins becomes possible. \n\nAdditionally, smart investments can attract new users to the ecosystem. Let's expect that user activity will decline in the middle of 2026. \n\nThe likely reason for allocating only 60M ADA to the next three Catalyst Funds (20M for each fund) is the higher market price of ADA.\n\nWhat I find missing in the budget are investments in DeFi and the minting of stablecoins. \n\nI envision minting 1-2M stablecoins each epoch, such as USDM and DJED. The cost would be around 140M USD, which translates to about 140M ADA if the average price of ADA throughout the bull market is 1 USD. \n\nHowever, if the average price of ADA were higher, say 2 USD, the cost in the ADA value would be half as much. The budget calculates that 1 ADA is 0.5 USD. That doesn't seem adequate to me.\n\nThis is a topic we should discuss and consider.\n\nCan the current budget be reduced? Can we allocate ADA differently?\n\nI don’t want to criticize the high costs line by line without knowing all the details. I’ll use common sense. \n\nFeel free to correct me or provide important context.\n\nOn-chain governance seems excessively expensive to me. While DReps can vote on governance actions, Intersect and various committees will cost us tens of millions of ADA. \n\nWith such a high budget, we risk depleting a significant amount of ADA in the treasury during the next bear market.\n\nThe costs of the Budget Committee also seem high. Some processes could be more cost-effective. Do we really need a Budget Summit? DReps can meet at the Cardano Summit (see below).\n\nAllocating 20M ADA for IntersectMBO seems like a lot. \n\nWhen I looked at the individual items, the total was 2.7M ADA. Perhaps I am misunderstanding something.\n\nRegarding the Product Committee category, the costs appear high, especially for items that we may not need or that I believe were already ready.\n\nIf I'm not mistaken, the multi-resource consensus Minotaur is being built for Midnight, not Cardano. The same applies to Proof of Useful Work.\n\nI would like to focus primarily on scalability, ZK technology, L2s, and other technologies that Cardano needs as soon as possible. Some items in the budget can wait.\n\nI would like to see a budget linked to the roadmap. We need the strategy first. Then make the roadmap and link it with the budget.\n\nThe largest costs in the budget relate to the Technical Steering Committee. Core Maintenance will cost us 40M ADA. This seems like a huge expense and is worth investigating in more detail.\n\nIn the 80M ADA allocated for the Membership & Community Committee, 60M ADA is for three Catalyst Funds. This leaves us with 20M ADA to discuss. \n\nI have never heard of Community Hubs. I know there were proposals to create various hubs in Catalyst, and some were funded. Do we really need to invest 3.2M ADA in the Community Hub?\n\n11.2M ADA is allocated for The Civic Committee. This includes compensation for committee members and DReps. \n\n1.8M ADA is allocated for DReps, which is roughly 0.5% of the total budget. While the prevailing opinion is that DReps should work for free, I believe using 0.5% of the budget for their rewards is reasonable. DReps and committee members deserve some compensation.\n\nDReps decide on the budget. They can save ADA or better direct the budget.\n\nA topic worth discussing is whether DReps should be more involved in internal processes. DReps are elected by the community, and if they are interested, they should be members of committees and participate in tasks like compiling the budget. \n\nPerhaps only those DReps who are more involved in these processes should be paid.\n\nI would halve the 20M ADA allocated for the Growth & Marketing Committee. Cardano needs to invest in technology, not marketing. I more or less agree with the items in the Growth section.\n\n3.1M ADA is the cost for Cardano Summit 2026. I would agree with that and link it directly to other meetings, such as the DReps meeting and the debate on the next budget.\n\nI would definitely not pay influencers. I don't believe this type of marketing works.\n\nI approve of 3.8M ADA for the Open Source Committee and would gladly increase the budget if possible, provided we save money elsewhere.\n\nDespite my reservations about the budget and my efforts to reduce some costs, I might be willing to approve the budget. I'm not sure yet. I would like to see some changes.\n\nThe budget will still change based on community input, so please comment on the Cardano Forum.\n\nMy opinion is that we should save on marketing, maybe on Community Hubs, development of technologies that Cardano does not need in the next 2 years, and other items and rather mint stablecoins.\n\nEveryone will have a different opinion on the budget. It will be difficult to find consensus in a decentralized environment. Therefore, I will tend to approve the budget unless I find a fundamental problem. I will continue to examine the budget and comment on it if needed.\n\nI am curious about the final version.",

We control the purse strings as is enshrined in the constitution.\n\nIntersect is not a finance/ budgeting or entrepreneurial organization. It’s simply a MBO. Drafting a budget consisting of potentially $100’s Millions of dollars annually for an entire ecosystem and executing it should have ZERO participation from amateurs with no experience and subject matter expertise. \n\nProfessionals should have be retained on behalf of the community. \n\nIntersect could have asked DReps, on-chain, for the mandate to screen, recruit and retain said experts. \n\nThat’s one vote.\n\nSecond vote is design of process.\n\nThird vote is creating funding categories.\n\nFourth vote is on $$ allocation and priorities.\n\nAnd so on…..\n\nEvery vote should have been DRep led. Potentially facilitated by Intersect.\n\nAt no point whatsoever should Intersect, whom are entirely unqualified for this task, took it on themselves to create the budget.\n\nIt’s time to pivot, make up on lost ground and time and execute. Cardano has business to do, projects to fund and goals this year to accomplish.\n\nMy dRep ID:\n\ndrep14pjm8ytt682wkp4jcegdj2yerkcy9a20xevvp7udlcd0ggjxdud\n\n$ADA @cardano_whale @IOHK_Charles @RichardMcCrackn @jasonappleton"

The UX is terrible for viewing multiple proposals, and there is no high level data aggregation which makes everything more difficult for DReps.\n\nTo help streamline things for all of us, I’ve made a budget spreadsheet with the data from the https://t.co/FPs8Wq7glV budget proposals here 👇\n\nhttps://t.co/kNdhf2u6w7\n\nFor some reason everyone can pick their rate of conversion for ADA to USD, which just makes a big mess of the numbers with variable conversion rates and has resulted in errors.\n\nI’ve flagged all proposals in red that have incorrect ADA to USD conversion rates, and have also created a balanced conversion rate for all proposals at the same rate that the @IntersectCBC  budget has been converted at ($0.50 USD).\n\nProviding everything in the currently submitted budget passes, we would still come under Net Change Limit if it is decided that this should be 350,000,000 ADA.\n\nWe are looking at 265,387,604 ADA from the Intersect budget, and 62,916,370 ADA from these new budget submissions.\n\nThis would put us at 328,303,974 $ADA , not including any new additions or any budget submissions by the CF or Emurgo.\n\nI personally want to spend significantly less than 350 Million ADA, so I will be voting no on the majority of these new proposals.\n\nI also think that the current Intersect budget still needs some cutting and further explaining, but this new budget process has been a great deflection to get eyes off of the existing @IntersectMBO budget 👀\n\nYou can see my full discussion on the Cardano 2025 budget here on the Cardano Forum:\n\nhttps://t.co/BvJNWbBvjf",

We are still at the beginning — but it’s a promising one.\n\nIF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A DREP MY ID IS: drep1y2jd3c4hgg0tdua58z6c64k9rf58lz3jlcjlxcjfeaspl6q2e9zm6\n\nProposals I voted YES for: \n\n- Cardano Maintenance and Roadmap Delivery Proposal: Secure Ada Network Infrastructure for the enTire cardano communitY\n- Input Output Research (IOR): Cardano Vision - Work Program 2025\n- A member-based organization for the Cardano ecosystem: Intersect\n- Beyond Minimum Viable Governance: Iteratively Improving on Cardano Voltaire\n- The Cardano community's open-source tool for participation in its governance: Cardano Govtool\n- Cardano Product Committee: Community-driven - 2030 Cardano Vision and 2026 roadmap insights collection via workshops and structured product research\n- 2025 Input Output Engineering Core Development Proposal\n- UTxO RPC: Sustaining Cardano Blockchain Integration\n- Dolos: Sustaining a Lightweight Cardano Data Node\n- Pallas: Sustaining Critical Rust Tooling for Cardano\n- MLabs Core Tool Maintenance & Enhancement: Ply\n- MLabs Core Tool Maintenance & Enhancement: CLB\n- MLabs Maintenance & Enhancement: Atlas PAB\n- MLabs Core Tool Maintenance & Enhancement: Cardano Transaction Library (CTL)\n- MLabs Core Tool Maintenance & Enhancement: Plutarch\n- Extended Symbolic\n- Lucid Evolution Maintenance\n- OSC Budget Proposal - Paid Open Source Model for Sustainable Development\n- zkFold ZK Rollup\n- Atlas PAB: Hydra and L2 Integration (Midgard, Midnight, ZkFold)\n- Blockfrost Platform Community Budget Proposal\n- Extended UPLC Converter\n- Complete Web3 developer stack to make Cardano the smart contract layer for Bitcoin\n- Midgard - Optimistic Rollups\n- Gerolamo - cardano node in typescript\n- Atlas PAB - Chainlink Oracle Integration\n- ZK Bridge\n- Atlas PAB: Aiken and Governance Integration\n - Atlas PAB: Hydra and L2 Integration (Midgard, Midnight, ZkFold)\n- AdaStat..net Cardano blockchain explorer\n- Quality Assurance: On-Chain & Off-Chain Audit\n- ADAspending,com - Cardano Treasury Explorer - An open data source for tracking treasury spending on the Cardano blockchain\n- DRep Incentivization Framework\n- SyncGovHub: An intelligent Transparent, and Action-Oriented Platform for Cardano Governance\n- Cardano Constitutional Committee Formation and - Governance Training with the SanchoNet Education Network\n- Cardano Governance MCP: natural language access to governance data\n- The Cardano community's open-source tool for participation in its governance: Cardano Govtool\n- Membership & Community Committee (MCC) - Global Community Hubs Expansion Program\n- Cardano Summit 2025 and regional tech events\n- Cardano Builder DAO\n- Marketing Infrastructure for Cardano\n- Amplify Cardano: Community-Led Events Fund by Rare Network\n- Amplify Cardano: Community-Led Marketing Fund by - Rare Network\n- Business Lead Generation on Cardano\n- Cardano Ecosystem Pavilions at Exhibitions\n- A.L.B.A. Network\n- Cardano Curation Short-Form Video Marketing Initiative\n- Catalyst 2025 Proposal by Input Output: Advancing Decentralised Community Innovation Funding & Infrastructure\n- Growth & Marketing Committee (GMC) Budget Proposal"

          "text": "It’s time to report on my recent votes! Long read below 👇\n\nStarting with the NCL, I voted in favor of a larger 350m limit. The main reasoning was that a delay in funding could be detrimental for many smaller projects on Cardano. Without the NCL, treasury withdrawals cannot be done, so we needed to set up one. Now that this problem is solved, I am considering whether it makes sense to lower the limit to 200m. Currently, leaning no on this one as I believe we are at a critical moment for the ecosystem and have to spend resources aggressively to catch up in the areas where we are lagging.\n\nRegarding the budget items, my process was as follows. Having limited time, I prioritized a) more expensive items that have a bigger impact on the budget and b) more technical items where I have some expertise. My default was the “abstain” option, which I used in situations where I felt I could not offer a good insight on why the proposal should be accepted or rejected. I am obviously biased about @zkFold’s proposals, but I tried to consider every proposal on its own merit and not how it would benefit us as a company (as you can see below). I also paid a lot of attention to the costs. I believe there’s (almost?) no irreplaceable vendors, and so there’s always room for negotiation with regards to outputs and cost. Everything below is my personal opinion as a DRep. Notable items that I voted on:\n\n- @InputOutputHK's research proposal was one of the easiest votes. We should definitely advance in those research items as they provide our ecosystem with an edge over the competition. And the price tag is moderate, all things considered.\n\n- Next, I also voted in favor of the @InputOutputHK's development proposal.

          "originalText": "It’s time to report on my recent votes! Long read below 👇\n\nStarting with the NCL, I voted in favor of a larger 350m limit. The main reasoning was that a delay in funding could be detrimental for many smaller projects on Cardano. Without the NCL, treasury withdrawals cannot be done, so we needed to set up one. Now that this problem is solved, I am considering whether it makes sense to lower the limit to 200m. Currently, leaning no on this one as I believe we are at a critical moment for the ecosystem and have to spend resources aggressively to catch up in the areas where we are lagging.\n\nRegarding the budget items, my process was as follows. Having limited time, I prioritized a) more expensive items that have a bigger impact on the budget and b) more technical items where I have some expertise. My default was the “abstain” option, which I used in situations where I felt I could not offer a good insight on why the proposal should be accepted or rejected. I am obviously biased about @zkFold’s proposals, but I tried to consider every proposal on its own merit and not how it would benefit us as a company (as you can see below). I also paid a lot of attention to the costs. I believe there’s (almost?) no irreplaceable vendors, and so there’s always room for negotiation with regards to outputs and cost. Everything below is my personal opinion as a DRep. Notable items that I voted on:\n\n- @InputOutputHK's research proposal was one of the easiest votes. We should definitely advance in those research items as they provide our ecosystem with an edge over the competition. And the price tag is moderate, all things considered.\n\n- Next, I also voted in favor of the @InputOutputHK's development proposal. Most of the items make total sense to me, although the cost is high. It is a minor thing, but I do hope the Babel fees project is just marketed as such, but is actually a comprehensive solution for partially balanced transactions. Babel fees are being implemented independently by different ecosystem players, including @FluidTokens and @zkFold. They do not require a hardfork, per se.

Thought it might be helpful to post for everyone what the Cardano Constitution requires:\n\n1. An administrator Is Constitutionally Required--\nThe Constitution mandates that all Cardano ecosystem budgets must designate one or more administrators to oversee treasury funds.

Midgard, #Bitcoin integration, and Zk Rollups were top of mind, but key suppliers include:\n\n@MLabs10 @tweagio @txpipe_tools @zkFold  @AnastasiaLabs @GeniusyieldO @DripDropz_io  @cexplorer_io @ada_stat @eternlwallet @nftcdn_io  @adahandle \n\nThe OSC Budget Proposal - Paid Open Source Model for Sustainable Development should also be funded.\n\nCritical Governance Support:\n\n1⃣ Cardano Constitutional Committee Formation and Governance Training with the SanchoNet Education Network by @Hornan7\n\nThis is a must to continue the future of on chain governance.\n\n2⃣ Quality Assurance: On-Chain & Off-Chain Audit by @jrv97_velazquez\n\nWe need an independent audit process for fund distribution, and this was by far the best proposal.\n\nMarketing by the community, not CF or Emurgo:\n\n1⃣Cardano Ecosystem Pavilions at Exhibitions\n2⃣Amplify Cardano: Community-Led Events Fund by Rare Network @RareEvo \n3⃣Amplify Cardano: Community-Led Marketing Fund by Rare Network\n4⃣Cardano Rising: Japan Delegation to Rare Evo for Media and Enterprise Impact by Lightning Communications\n5⃣Cardano Japan Renaissance by Pacific Meta Inc.\n\nMarketing by CF @Cardano_CF :\n\n✅Cardano Summit 2025 and regional tech events\n\nThe CF has multiple marketing proposals, but this is the only one I feel they would be best to deliver.\n\nThey also have a very high ask, and I believe they should be compensated partially for their marketing efforts (like the Cardano summit), but not everything.\n\nThe CF has genesis ADA they should be spending for the betterment of the Cardano community.\n\n❌ No Proposals by Emurgo @emurgo_io \n\nThey have a pile of genesis ADA that they should be using to fund marketing and business initiatives as the business arm of Cardano.\n\nInstead they are using genesis ADA to downvote competing marketing proposals by actual Cardano community members.\n\nThere is a serious conflict of interest going on with Emurgo / @YoroiWallet and the use of genesis ADA and wallet delegations to their benefit.\n\nI will not support this kind of blatant abuse of our governance system and treasury funds.\n\nIntersect @IntersectMBO  didn't convince me that they should get 15 Million ADA in operations cost, so they also got a no vote.\n\nOverall I appreciate all the work that has been put into making this happen by everyone.\n\nIf I voted no on your proposal, it was likely due to cost constraints, that the proposal was better suited to Catalyst, or that there was not enough information provided to justify voting yes.\n\nI left feedback for some proposals, but due to time constraints not all.\n\nA huge thanks goes out to @adamKDean and @MadOrkestra for making Ekklesia 🔥\n\nAnother big thanks goes out to all the volunteers and community members who got us this far, and to all the DReps who truly care and contributed.\n\nThank you so much!❤️",

Midgard, #Bitcoin integration, and Zk Rollups were top of mind, but key suppliers include:\n\n@MLabs10 @tweagio @txpipe_tools @zkFold  @AnastasiaLabs @GeniusyieldO @DripDropz_io  @cexplorer_io @ada_stat @eternlwallet @nftcdn_io  @adahandle \n\nThe OSC Budget Proposal - Paid Open Source Model for Sustainable Development should also be funded.\n\nCritical Governance Support:\n\n1⃣ Cardano Constitutional Committee Formation and Governance Training with the SanchoNet Education Network by @Hornan7\n\nThis is a must to continue the future of on chain governance.\n\n2⃣ Quality Assurance: On-Chain & Off-Chain Audit by @jrv97_velazquez\n\nWe need an independent audit process for fund distribution, and this was by far the best proposal.\n\nMarketing by the community, not CF or Emurgo:\n\n1⃣Cardano Ecosystem Pavilions at Exhibitions\n2⃣Amplify Cardano: Community-Led Events Fund by Rare Network @RareEvo \n3⃣Amplify Cardano: Community-Led Marketing Fund by Rare Network\n4⃣Cardano Rising: Japan Delegation to Rare Evo for Media and Enterprise Impact by Lightning Communications\n5⃣Cardano Japan Renaissance by Pacific Meta Inc.\n\nMarketing by CF @Cardano_CF :\n\n✅Cardano Summit 2025 and regional tech events\n\nThe CF has multiple marketing proposals, but this is the only one I feel they would be best to deliver.\n\nThey also have a very high ask, and I believe they should be compensated partially for their marketing efforts (like the Cardano summit), but not everything.\n\nThe CF has genesis ADA they should be spending for the betterment of the Cardano community.\n\n❌ No Proposals by Emurgo @emurgo_io \n\nThey have a pile of genesis ADA that they should be using to fund marketing and business initiatives as the business arm of Cardano.\n\nInstead they are using genesis ADA to downvote competing marketing proposals by actual Cardano community members.\n\nThere is a serious conflict of interest going on with Emurgo / @YoroiWallet and the use of genesis ADA and wallet delegations to their benefit.\n\nI will not support this kind of blatant abuse of our governance system and treasury funds.\n\nIntersect @IntersectMBO  didn't convince me that they should get 15 Million ADA in operations cost, so they also got a no vote.\n\nOverall I appreciate all the work that has been put into making this happen by everyone.\n\nIf I voted no on your proposal, it was likely due to cost constraints, that the proposal was better suited to Catalyst, or that there was not enough information provided to justify voting yes.\n\nI left feedback for some proposals, but due to time constraints not all.\n\nA huge thanks goes out to @adamKDean and @MadOrkestra for making Ekklesia 🔥\n\nAnother big thanks goes out to all the volunteers and community members who got us this far, and to all the DReps who truly care and contributed.\n\nThank you so much!❤️"

          "text": "🚫I voted NO on the Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Budget of 275M ADA, administered by Intersect.\n\nRationale:\n\nI strongly oppose bundling all proposals into a single bundle for DReps to approve.\n\nCritical proposals are grouped with less important or unnecessary ones, many of which belong to Catalyst.\n\nBudget responsibility requires making decisions on individual proposals or smaller bundles, not one large one.\n\nProposal Breakdown:\n\n• In Ekklesia, I voted YES for 35 proposals totaling 213.3M ADA—which is 62M ADA lower than the collective DRep-approved budget in Ekklesia.\n\n• A separate GA exists for six of the proposals I supported—these are top-tier projects that most DReps agree will positively impact the ecosystem.\n\n• Intersect’s GA includes 19 proposals I want to support, totaling 204.2M ADA, including four IOG projects with a combined budget of 194M ADA.\n\n• At the same time, 14 proposals totaling 65.5M ADA were proposals I did not support in Ekklesia.\n\nAssuming that IOG is able to submit its own GA for their proposals, I am talking about supporting 15 proposals with a total budget of 10M ADA that I want to support. \n\nAgainst this are 14 proposals with a budget of 65.5M ADA that I do not want to support.\n\nAs a DRep, I cannot accept it.\n\nIn my case, this imbalance makes the bundled approach unacceptable. I believe that many DReps will struggle with this as well.\n\nPreferred Alternative:\n\nI urge teams to submit their own GAs or ask Intersect to structure proposals by category or threshold.\n\n• On-chain voting for individual proposals would be ideal, though the 100K ADA deposit for GA submissions is a challenge for many projects.\n\n• Smaller, more focused GA bundles would allow better decision-making.\n\nNet Change Limit (NCL) Concerns:\n\nThe current NCL is unclear, making a 275M ADA budget approval premature. There are two active GAs regarding NCL:\n\n1. 200M ADA NCL that expires May 29, 2025.\n2. 300M ADA NCL that expires June 8, 2025.\n\nThe existing NCL received strong support, but many DReps may have backed it simply to keep the budget process moving, not because they favored a high limit.\n\nUntil DReps align on the NCL, approving such a large budget makes little sense.\n\nThis GA expires June 13, 2025. If both active NCL GAs fail, confirming the current NCL, I will still have one epoch to reconsider my vote.\n\nNext Steps & My Position:\n\nI urge DReps to vote on the NCL GAs as soon as possible.\n\nI continue to believe that budgetary responsibility is best maintained by voting on individual proposals rather than relying on an NCL. Let’s handle this on-chain.\n\nMy NO vote is a signal to Intersect that I support a process change. I do not want to approve one large bundle worth 275M ADA—I prefer individual votes or smaller proposal bundles.\n\nHowever, my support for the projects I voted YES in Ekklesia remains firm. I will vote YES if they submit their own GA.\n\nI am also open to reconsidering all proposals, as long as they come through proper GA submissions.\n\nUltimately, I believe the ideal NCL should be around 250M ADA, with 10M ADA kept as a reserve for emergencies.\n\nBalancing monetary policy protection and ecosystem investment is a challenge—we must minimize selling pressure while funding growth.\n\nThe solution is ensuring that only projects with a positive long-term impact receive ADA from the Treasury.\n\nIn my view, some proposals in the current bundle are unnecessary.\n\nMy DRep ID:\ndrep1km69g7ksf8t5g0h9d9tkrcd2tezxelx0wtr76rv2mrkl5nzd6v3",

I believe that many DReps will struggle with this as well.\n\nPreferred Alternative:\n\nI urge teams to submit their own GAs or ask Intersect to structure proposals by category or threshold.\n\n• On-chain voting for individual proposals would be ideal, though the 100K ADA deposit for GA submissions is a challenge for many projects.\n\n• Smaller, more focused GA bundles would allow better decision-making.\n\nNet Change Limit (NCL) Concerns:\n\nThe current NCL is unclear, making a 275M ADA budget approval premature. There are two active GAs regarding NCL:\n\n1. 200M ADA NCL that expires May 29, 2025.\n2. 300M ADA NCL that expires June 8, 2025.\n\nThe existing NCL received strong support, but many DReps may have backed it simply to keep the budget process moving, not because they favored a high limit.\n\nUntil DReps align on the NCL, approving such a large budget makes little sense.\n\nThis GA expires June 13, 2025. If both active NCL GAs fail, confirming the current NCL, I will still have one epoch to reconsider my vote.\n\nNext Steps & My Position:\n\nI urge DReps to vote on the NCL GAs as soon as possible.\n\nI continue to believe that budgetary responsibility is best maintained by voting on individual proposals rather than relying on an NCL. Let’s handle this on-chain.\n\nMy NO vote is a signal to Intersect that I support a process change. I do not want to approve one large bundle worth 275M ADA—I prefer individual votes or smaller proposal bundles.\n\nHowever, my support for the projects I voted YES in Ekklesia remains firm. I will vote YES if they submit their own GA.\n\nI am also open to reconsidering all proposals, as long as they come through proper GA submissions.\n\nUltimately, I believe the ideal NCL should be around 250M ADA, with 10M ADA kept as a reserve for emergencies.\n\nBalancing monetary policy protection and ecosystem investment is a challenge—we must minimize selling pressure while funding growth.\n\nThe solution is ensuring that only projects with a positive long-term impact receive ADA from the Treasury.\n\nIn my view, some proposals in the current bundle are unnecessary.\n\nMy DRep ID:\ndrep1km69g7ksf8t5g0h9d9tkrcd2tezxelx0wtr76rv2mrkl5nzd6v3"

Some of these missions have been nominally completed, some of these missions continue in their original form, some continue in a new form. I do not pretend to know all the nuances. \n\nStill I take that as a factor in my decision-making. Treasury funds should be used judiciously in complement and in awareness of the existence of the entities. \n\nThis vote against this Budget in its full size is based on:\n\n1. My participation in the DRep voting stage and the level of DRep participation as a whole;\n2. The level of support that some proposals received relative to others;\n3. The relative importance of certain proposals vs others and the quality of the teams and their dedication to Cardano’s mission;\n4. And the expectation that Catalyst will likely gain sufficient support (in this or future budget proposals) to continue to support smaller, experimental, or commercial projects.\n\nWhile spending from the Treasury is not new (Catalyst has done it before), this is the first major annual on-chain budget, and it sets a precedent.\n\nIn my view, the issue is not inflation within the Cardano economy — most ADA will not be used to buy NFTs or FTs. Nor is it simply about a slightly higher disinflation rate. The deeper issue is ADA devaluation due to external sell pressure. Most of the funded ADA will be exchanged for fiat (USD, EUR, etc.), not recycled internally. This adds downward pressure on ADA’s price.\n\nIt is a see-saw that has its quirks. \n\nIn a real-world economy, if you spend more to \"jumpstart\" the economy, face inflation if the supply of services and goods cannot meet demand. \n\nIn a still nascent blockchain economy, spending more essentially means converting the native token for fiat, and the result is devaluation. We are not exchanging ADA directly for Cardano economy goods and services, we are selling it into the real world. The ADA is not recycled internally. This adds downward pressure on ADA’s price.\n\nThis devaluation affects everyone:\n\n1. The most important funded projects\n2. The projects that were not funded\n3. The builders who didn’t ask for funding \n4. The ADA holders who fund all of it through opportunity cost\n\nOf course, that is unavoidable. Most of the ADA allocated will likely be converted to fiat (USD, EUR, etc.) to pay for services, not retained or reused within the ecosystem. This creates exchange rate pressure, weakening ADA’s value.\n\nThe question isn’t whether devaluation will occur — it will. The real question is: Where do we draw the line? Do all 39 proposals in this budget bring more value than the cost of the devaluation they collectively impose? Do we need to bundle them all in one YES/NO budget vote? I think No. \n\nWe are approving a large, externally-focused budget at a time when Cardano’s “blockchain economy” and governance mechanism is still immature and internally fragile.\n\nTreasury funds should primarily be focused on critical public goods in different forms. Especially if they are open source; support infrastructure, research, tools, even education, promotion of Cardano. This applies when the goods align with the long-term mission of Cardano as public infrastructure. Yes, there may be exceptions that emerge, but those exceptions are expensive — and others will pay for them.\n\nIf we overfund less impactful proposals, we risk undermining the impact of the most critical ones, simply by diluting the value of what they are paid in.\n\nFor this reason, I believe a smaller, phased budget focused tightly on foundational public goods would be a better and safer starting point.\n\nI include this rationale as an earnest view of the proposed budget action with the aim of contributing to the process by encouraging the submitter (Intersect) to take more factors into account.",

          "motivation": "The 2025 Cardano budget, established through the Intersect-led process, is designed to ensure Cardano remains secure, competitive, and growth-oriented during this pivotal first year of decentralized, constitutional governance. The total treasury allocation adheres to the community-approved Net Change Limit (NCL) of ₳350 million ada, reflecting our shared commitment to long-term financial sustainability.\nA key issue in the initial budget process was the misapplication of the participation threshold. The 50% + 1 Lovelace threshold was calculated based on total ada participating in the vote, rather than the active voting stake—which significantly alters the democratic weight of participating DReps.

ADA holders, through Delegated Representatives (DReps) and Constitutional Committee oversight, vote on funding proposals within a capped Net Change Limit of 350 million ADA. The process includes two stages: community signaling and a binding on-chain Info Action vote.\nIntersect, a member-based organization, facilitates the process by organizing submissions and offering domain expertise, while final decisions rest with the community. Intersect also serves as the administrator for the use of approved funds.\nCurrent metrics show 11.22B ADA delegated, with 3.92B cast in Ekklesia—72% participation of active voting power. Yet, several proposals advanced without meeting a basic 50 + 1 Lovelace% threshold (2.69B ADA), raising concerns about legitimacy and governance integrity.\nThis info action aim to help community builders to quickly get approval onchain while individually they might not have 100k ADA deposit readily available. We submit all proposals (except founding entity proposals) that have met the 2.69B threshold for inclusion. Without respecting the safeguards put in place within the Cardano Constitution, low-support proposals may continue to pass, risking public confidence within the entire budgetary process. \nThe 2025 budget process reflects Cardano’s Voltaire vision—but its long-term success depends on transparency and accountability aligned with the constitution.",

        "rationale": "The 2025 Cardano budget process is built to reconcile strategic planning with decentralized authority, ensuring that treasury allocations are community-driven, constitutionally sound, and economically sustainable. It emphasizes transparency, voting legitimacy, and fiscal restraint—all within the framework of the Cardano Constitution and Net Change Limit (NCL).\n\n---\n\n### 1. Proposal Submission & Consolidation\n\nThe process began with dual intake:\n\n- **Block Budgets** from Intersect’s seven working committees (technical, governance, marketing, etc.)\n- **Open Submissions** from any Cardano contributor, regardless of Intersect membership.\n\nAll submissions were standardized—detailing problem, benefit, roadmap alignment, and cost—to ensure fair and structured evaluation. Founding entities (Intersect, IOG, Cardano Foundation, Emurgo) were expected to submit **independent Info Actions** and were **not bundled** with the general budget. This ensures neutrality and reinforces that **this budget includes only community and committee proposals that met threshold—excluding those from founding entities**.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Community Signaling\n\nAn off-chain signaling phase enabled DReps and ADA holders to express preliminary support via GovTool and Ekklesia. Only proposals that achieved **more than 50% approval by voting power** (a minimum of **2.69 billion ADA**, or 50%+1 Lovelace of the 5.38B active voting stake) were advanced to the *Budget Info Action*.\n\nEkklesia recorded just **3.92B in voting participation**, raising concerns that **proposals receiving less than 2.69B ADA in support—but still included—would not represent majority consensus**. This budget seeks to correct that by **excluding all proposals that failed to meet the full quorum** and by **removing founding entity proposals**, even if they surpassed the threshold. This aims to address prior practices resembling **voter engineering or gerrymandering**, where under-supported proposals were pushed through by bundling or procedural manipulation.\n\n---\n\n### 3. On-Chain Budget Approval (Budget Info Action)\n\nProposals that passed community signaling with >2.69B ADA were packaged into this *Budget Info Action* for on-chain ratification. In accordance with **Article IV of the Cardano Constitution**, a valid budget requires:\n\n- A **DRep vote surpassing 50%+1 Lovelace of active voting power** (≥2.69B ADA)\n- A **minimum of 5 out of 7 Constitutional Committee votes** affirming that the budget complies with the Constitution\n- All treasury disbursements to remain **within the 2025 Net Change Limit** (350 million ADA)\n\n---\n\nThis *Budget Info Action* complies with all of the above. DReps now vote knowing that **only proposals that passed the threshold and are constitutionally sound are included**.",

        "motivation": "The 2025 Cardano budget, established through the Intersect-led process, is designed to ensure Cardano remains secure, competitive, and growth-oriented during this pivotal first year of decentralized, constitutional governance. The total treasury allocation adheres to the community-approved Net Change Limit (NCL) of ₳350 million ada, reflecting our shared commitment to long-term financial sustainability.\nA key issue in the initial budget process was the misapplication of the participation threshold. The 50% + 1 Lovelace threshold was calculated based on total ada participating in the vote, rather than the active voting stake—which significantly alters the democratic weight of participating DReps. This discrepancy risks enabling governance distortion through low-turnout manipulation, akin to gerrymandering.\nTo safeguard against such vulnerabilities and uphold the integrity of Cardano’s governance process, this Info Action includes only those proposals submitted by community builders (that might not have 100k ADA deposit) and met the corrected threshold of 2.69B ada, equivalent to 50% + 1 Lovelace of the active registered voting stake.

        "summary": "The proposal for the 2025 Cardano budget process aims to establish a community-driven, constitutionally sound, and economically sustainable framework for treasury allocations, operating within the Net Change Limit (NCL). It emphasizes transparency and voting legitimacy by standardizing submissions, requiring significant community signaling (over 50% active voting power, e.g., a minimum of 2.69 billion ADA) for proposals to advance to a binding on-chain vote, and ensuring founding entities submit independent funding actions. This approach directly addresses past concerns about low-support proposals progressing or practices resembling 'voter engineering,' by strictly excluding proposals that fail to meet this established quorum. The background context highlights Cardano's current technical challenges (e.g., throughput constraints, Layer-2 complexity with Hydra, and developer tooling) and its competitive landscape. This underscores the critical need for a robust and strategic funding process to advance key technical roadmap priorities, such as Layer-2 scaling solutions like Hydra, core protocol evolution (including Voltaire governance features), and improved developer resources, thereby enhancing Cardano's position as a secure, sustainable, and efficient blockchain platform.",
        "myOpinion": "I support this proposal for the 2025 Cardano budget process framework. Its core merits lie in significantly enhancing the legitimacy, transparency, and community-driven nature of treasury allocations. The strict adherence to a substantial community signaling threshold (over 50% of active voting power) and the clear separation of funding requests from founding entities are crucial improvements. These measures directly address valid historical criticisms concerning the passage of under-supported proposals and potential 'voter engineering'. By ensuring that only proposals with demonstrated strong backing proceed to a formal on-chain DRep vote, the process fosters greater accountability. This aligns with key principles of decentralization and fairness, as it standardizes submission and evaluation processes for community and committee initiatives. While the proposal focuses on process rules, a sound, trusted, and efficient budget process is paramount for strategically funding projects vital to Cardano's technical evolution, such as Leios, Hydra, and Layer 2 scaling solutions, which are critical for its long-term sustainability and competitiveness. The primary concerns are less with the proposed rules themselves and more with their meticulous implementation: ensuring the calculation of signaling thresholds is robust and truly representative, that DReps have sufficient capacity for diligent review, and that the process remains adaptable to community feedback. The ultimate goal of making Cardano a secure, sustainable, and efficient platform, which may involve paying a premium for excellent engineering, is well-served by a budget process that prioritizes well-vetted and strongly supported initiatives."

          "text": "🔥 #Cardano Governance Update 🔥\n\nWhat's at stake for the future of Cardano: The Update, The Constitution, the Treasury, and the Budgets.\n\nThe Plomin Hard Fork \n\nThis update will be the final step to full participation in Cardano Governance as designed by CIP-1694. Expect to see the Plomin Hard Fork submitted on chain very soon.  A few months ago, when the Chang Hard Fork was enacted, it activated the Governance Bootstrap Phase which allowed Delegated Representatives (DReps) to register on-chain and established the Constitutional Committee (CC) to vote on Governance Actions (GAs) along with Stake Pool Operators (SPOs).  However, governance was limited.\n\nOnce the Plomin Hard Fork passes the DReps will gain full voting power, not just the ability to vote on Info Actions (visit https://t.co/aRWErA7Waj for a guide to the different type of Governance Actions).  This means that the Cardano Community will be able to update the Cardano Constitution and withdraw funds from the Cardano Treasury.\n\nWhy do we care about establishing the Constitution and withdrawing funds from the Treasury?  Well, quite frankly, it's because Cardano has grown up and we have to start living on our own now.  When Cardano was launched in 2017 the pioneering entities were given grants of Ada (about 20% of the total supply) in order to deliver us a decentralized ecosystem that the we, the users, could govern ourselves.  Now that we have the power of governance we need to firmly set the ground rules that protects the rights of everyone who interacts in the Cardano ecosystem, we need to collectively decide on the future development roadmap of Cardano, and we need to have a way to pay for it!\n\nThe Constitution\n\nThe past few months have been a historic time for Cardano as the community engaged in a deliberative process to draft a new Constitution.  While an Interim Constitution had been established with the Chang Hard Fork that document was written with an intentional plan for replacement.  @IntersectMBO with the help of @InputOutputHK, @Cardano_CF, @emurgo_io, and countless community contributors held 63 workshops across the world where Delegates for a Constitutional Convention were selected. These Delegates participated in synthesis sessions to review the language of the proposed new constitution that had been drafted by the Cardano Civics Committee of Intersect, solicited community feedback on proposed changes, and then came together in Buenos Aires and Nairobi to debate and approve a final draft.\n\nAll that being said, this new Constitution is not yet approved!  In a decentralized ecosystem of blockchain technology like Cardano, the establishment of a new Constitution cannot be valid until the Ada holders, as represented by their DReps, vote in favor.  Once the Plomin Hard Fork has passed (fingers crossed!) the community will be able to consider a Governance Action to ratify the new Constitution.  We can continue to operate under the Interim Constitution, if we must, but it would be far preferable to move to a new Constitution that came from a community review process as soon as possible.\n\nThe Treasury\n\nOne of the most unique and powerful aspects of Cardano is that we have a common Treasury to provide for the operation, maintenance, and future development of the blockchain ecosystem. Each Epoch, 20% of the Rewards Pool (transaction fees and monetary expansion) goes to the Treasury instead while the rest goes to Staking Rewards.\n\nBecause this Treasury comes out of the Staking Rewards that would otherwise go to the members of the Cardano Community, it is essential that the fund be safeguarded.  That is why the Interim Constitution and the proposed Constitution both specify that a Net Change Limit must be approved through a Governance Info Action before any Treasury Withdrawals are made.\n\nThe Net Change Limit that is adopted by the community must define how much Ada can be spent out of the Treasury in a certain amount of time.  For practical purposes (at least as we start), this will most likely mean that we decide how much to spend in 73 epochs (a calendar year).  Because the CC is obligated to vote down any Treasury Withdrawal GA that does not fit within the established Net Change Limit, we must make sure that this value fits within our planned spending for the year and allows for contingencies that may come up.  There is a fine balance to be struck!\n\nThe Budgets\n\nIn addition to the Net Change Limit, the Interim Constitution and the proposed Constitution specify that the no Treasury Withdrawal GA can pass unless it fits within a Budget that has been approved by the Cardano community through a vote by DReps.  The CC must also vote on any proposed budget to ensure that proposed spending does not violate the Constitution.\n\nWith text of the Constitution, the Budget requirements are purposefully flexible to give the Cardano Community options to fund the decentralized ecosystem.  While the Interim Constitution simply says there must be some Budget in place, the proposed Constitution is a bit more explicit in describing how each Budget must have an Administrator to ensure Treasury Withdrawals are properly spent.  This Administrator could be a person, an institution, or a smart contract, and I expect we will see this practice evolve over time.\n\nWhile anyone on Cardano can propose a budget, a large amount of community effort has been focused on working with @IntersectMBO to propose a comprehensive budget to support Cardano in 2025.  This process is nearing completion and the Budget Committee has stated they will be ready to report their proposal to the community soon.  They have already held numerous community meetings describing the process and soliciting feedback.\n\nOne of the keys to Intersect's approach will be to ensure that there is no single person in charge of the administration of funds.  The Budgets that Intersect will propose will give Administrator responsibilities to various committees of Intersect that are run by Cardano community members.  Again, we are seeking to balance the benefits of decentralization with the recognition that empowering people to act for the greater good is the best way to move a process forward.\n\nThe Timeline & Conclusion\n\nNow that we have a clear picture on what needs to happen for Cardano to move forward, we can discuss the timing of each action. Each time a Governance Action is proposed the Cardano community has 6 Epochs (30 days) to vote on it and then it takes one Epoch for the GA to take effect.  While most actions can pass early (if they get the necessary threshold of Yes votes) it is best to make a conservative estimate that the vote will run the full length of time possible.\n\nIf the Plomin Hard Fork GA is submitted on December 21 (the beginning of Cardano Epoch 529) we are looking at probable enactment on January 24 (Epoch 536).  Then, and only then, can we reasonably submit the Constitution for ratification.  The Treasury will also be unlocked and DReps can consider Treasury Withdrawal Governance Actions.\n\nWhile the Treasury will be unlocked on January 24, provided that the Plomin Hard Fork GA passes, the CC will not approve any actions the DReps take to withdraw funds unless the Net Change Limit and at least one Budget have been approved.  That means that we will need to have the DReps and CC vote on Governance Info Actions to approve these items before any Treasury Withdrawals are submitted.\n\nFortunately, because DReps are able to vote for Info Actions right now, we do not need to wait for the Plomin Hard Fork to be enacted to begin these discussions.  The community can consider and vote on the Hard Fork, the Net Change Limit, and the proposed Budgets within the same window of time.  We have a lot of important issues to figure out but I am confident that we can work through them and show how decentralized governance can make a Top-10 Blockchain ecosystem not just function but thrive!\n\nIf you're a Blockchain Governance nerd like me, you've probably been nodding along as you read this and have been along for the ride up to this point.  If you're just getting into it and have read this far, I hope you'll join us for the next big step of the journey.  Either way, get some rest over the holidays, because January is going to be an exciting time for Cardano!",

Once consensus or strong momentum emerges, the proposals can be submitted on-chain for DReps and the ICC to consider.\n\n3⃣ Net-Change-Limit governance action:\nThe Net-Change-Limit, which determines how much can be drawn from the Treasury in a given period, might be submitted earlier if broad agreement forms around its value and metadata.\n\nIn general, we anticipate between four-eight weeks of off-chain collaboration, but this may be extended for further refinements—or accelerated if there’s strong community support.\n\nContribute!\n\nIf you’d like to get involved, please visit the Cardano Forum (special thanks to @Cardano_CF for their support) and add your thoughts and suggestions here ➡️ https://t.co/MNkzi50n7j\n\nAll shared documents are drafts and very much works in progress. The Budget Committee will keep everyone updated on progress and sentiment across proposals.\n\nThank you to everyone—especially our members—for dedicating your time and insight to getting us to this point. Let's get reviewing!"

The ecosystem urgently needs capital allocation to fund development initiatives. Delaying further to wait for another GA cycle would be counterproductive.\n\nIt’s important to consider that many DReps tend to vote in the final stages, and GA ratification typically takes around six epochs (approximately one month). \n\nIf this proposal is ratified, disbursement from the Treasury could begin in May or June. Hopefully!\n\nYes, a high NCL carries risk—it increases the likelihood of aggressive Treasury drawdowns.\n\nIt’s also worth emphasizing that DReps have the authority to approve spending far below the defined NCL. \n\nSome voices in the community warn that total expenditures might approach NCL, as if this were a guaranteed outcome. To me, that sounds like a doomsday scenario rather than a realistic forecast. \n\nThe responsibility ultimately lies with the DReps. If each funding decision is evaluated on its individual merits, such overspending can—and should—be avoided.\n\nI would support a new GA that proposes a lower NCL, somewhere between 200M and 250M ADA. I would likely vote YES for that.\n\nI am aware of the risk that a few big DReps, including one founding entity, have a very strong position and may refuse to approve a lower NCL.\n\nI am currently reviewing Budget Proposals and have identified around 20 of them that I am inclined to support.\n\nInitially, I assumed that 150M ADA would suffice as my personal NCL threshold. \n\nHowever, IOG’s request for ~97M ADA and Catalyst’s request for ~70M ADA compel me to raise that estimate. \n\nI prefer not to set a fixed limit yet, as new proposals continue to surface. Still, I aim to support an overall NCL below 250M ADA. \n\nI really hope I manage to keep it around 200M ADA.\n\nMy preference continues to lean strongly toward Catalyst over Budget Proposals.\n\nWhy? \n\nBecause most DReps have indicated a willingness to dedicate just one day per month to governance. \n\nAt present, there are 150 proposals requesting a total of 480M ADA. \n\nIt is dangerous to rely on decision-making by individuals who may spend just a few minutes per proposal. Some proposals may be overlooked entirely. That’s irresponsible.\n\nMy strategy remains unchanged: I will back only a few essential Budget Proposals alongside Catalyst. \n\nMost projects should seek funding through Catalyst.\n\nCatalyst offers several clear advantages:\n\n• A framework that has matured over the years.\n\n• Teams are familiar with their processes.\n\n• Funding caps per round introduce a level of fiscal discipline.\n\n• DReps can participate in community reviews and guide ADA holders on how to vote.\n\nBy contrast, the Budget Proposals system is completely untested, and the team behind it remains largely unknown. \n\nMoreover, Intersect requires a high operational cost.\n\nIt makes little sense to allocate hundreds of millions of ADA to a system that hasn't been proven.\n\nThis mechanism should be tested first, with limited funds. If successful, it could then be entrusted with a larger portion of Treasury resources.\n\nInterestingly, my poll shows that while there is a preference for Budget Proposals, support for Catalyst remains. \n\nSome respondents distrust both mechanisms.\n\nI monitor governance developments daily and will adapt as needed. \n\nIf I ultimately decide to change my NCL vote to NO, I’ll communicate that promptly. As of now, I have no such intention.\n\nThank you all for the feedback.\n\nMy DRep ID:\ndrep1km69g7ksf8t5g0h9d9tkrcd2tezxelx0wtr76rv2mrkl5nzd6v3",

          "text": "I appreciate the transparency. I have a few follow-up questions:\n\n1. Why was the decision made to only count the participating stake when calculating the approval threshold? Thereby deviating from the on-chain governance process.\n2. What happens if the approved proposals exceed the NCL?\n3. Will there only be two budget info actions submitted by Intersect?\n4. When will the budget info actions be submitted?\n5. Why is the first reconciliation Workshop 1 day longer?\n\nIn my opinion, the decision to count only participating stake, meaning only counting the voting power of DReps that vote yes or no, is too low of a threshold, especially since the voting phase is only two days.\n\nThere is a reason why non-participating stake behaves like a NO vote for all governance actions.\n\nIMHO only including participating stake and having a short voting window will make it too easy to be included. \n\nSome proposals will only be submitted tomorrow (April 24th), so there is not enough time to review them.\n\nTL;DR only considering participating stake with such a short voting period is a mistake that will decrease the legitimacy of the budget info actions",

Why was the decision made to only count the participating stake when calculating the approval threshold? Thereby deviating from the on-chain governance process.\n2. What happens if the approved proposals exceed the NCL?\n3. Will there only be two budget info actions submitted by Intersect?\n4. When will the budget info actions be submitted?\n5. Why is the first reconciliation Workshop 1 day longer?\n\nIn my opinion, the decision to count only participating stake, meaning only counting the voting power of DReps that vote yes or no, is too low of a threshold, especially since the voting phase is only two days.\n\nThere is a reason why non-participating stake behaves like a NO vote for all governance actions.\n\nIMHO only including participating stake and having a short voting window will make it too easy to be included. \n\nSome proposals will only be submitted tomorrow (April 24th), so there is not enough time to review them.\n\nTL;DR only considering participating stake with such a short voting period is a mistake that will decrease the legitimacy of the budget info actions"

          "text": "I voted NO ⛔️to reduce the Net Change Limit (NCL) to 200M ADA, which has been one of the toughest governance decisions so far. \n\nIt feels like there’s no entirely good option here.\n\nMoreover, I myself called for a lower NCL.\n\nThe current NCL of 350M ADA has some notable drawbacks.\n\nIf high selling pressure causes ADA’s price to drop significantly, say to 0.2 USD, it could result in serious challenges. \n\nFunding the ecosystem in dollar terms would require selling a large amount of ADA from the treasury, leading to a spiral of selling pressure that could worsen the situation.\n\nCardano Whale (@cardano_whale) pointed out that some projects like Tezos and Polkadot have invested heavily in their ecosystems, possess innovative technologies, yet struggle to gain substantial attention.\n\nI fully agree with that.\n\nFor blockchains, maintaining a presence in the top 10 market capitalization rankings is vital.\n\nRetail investors, institutions, and crypto enthusiasts evaluate projects not only based on technology but also on market performance. \n\nIf Cardano drops out of the top 10 for an extended period, it may never regain its position, regardless of decentralization or technological progress like Ouroboros Leios. \n\nThis is an important factor to consider, even if it feels unfair or subjective.\n\nOn the other hand, reducing the NCL to 200M ADA comes with its own set of concerns.\n\nCardano needs investments to advance its technology, support builders, and develop the ecosystem. Without increased user activity, Treasury revenue won't grow. \n\nSpending on maintenance and development in the next years risks exhausting the reserve, ultimately making Cardano economically unsustainable.\n\nProtocol security also hinges on attractive staking rewards and incentives. Moreover, Ouroboros Leios’s potential will remain untapped without active developers, tools, and a growing DeFi ecosystem. Investments in all these areas are crucial.\n\nIOG has made their funding requirements clear: Core Dev needs 96M ADA, Catalyst 69M ADA, and Research 27M ADA. Combined, this totals 192M ADA. The offer from IOG is simple: either approve this funding or let it be.\n\nDebates around fairness, IOG and Charles’s past contributions, and the definition of “completion” for Cardano have their place, but the reality is that IOG holds unmatched expertise in the protocol. No other entity can effectively take over maintenance, development, and research at the same pace or quality.\n\nIf DReps allocate 192M ADA to IOG, only 8M ADA remains for other projects.\n\nAfter reviewing budget proposals, I supported only the essentials I believe the ecosystem absolutely needs: projects like Midgard, Starstream, Hydra, ZK Rollups, Blockfrost, Lucid, Chainlink integration, and others. \n\nFor the CORE category alone, this amounts to around 12M ADA. Across all categories, my total approved budget comes to 213M ADA.\n\nGiven my own estimate of required expenditures is 213M ADA, I cannot support an NCL of 200M ADA. \n\nIt would contradict my stance on necessary project funding versus the cap I approve. This inconsistency guided my decision to vote NO on reducing the NCL.\n\nCardano requires effective marketing and improved governance support, as the current situation is far from ideal.\n\nInvesting in the ecosystem and advancing new technologies must go hand in hand to ensure sustainable growth.\n\nApproving the NCL of 200M ADA, in my view, would mean preserving the status quo, leaving all key responsibilities to IOG while neglecting investment in the broader ecosystem. \n\nEssentially, it would restrict funding for entities that are vital to the ecosystem, just as IOG is.\n\nAn important consideration is the expected scenarios surrounding the NCL.\n\nBoth NCLs, an NCL of 350M ADA and 200M ADA, are extremes in my view.\n\nThe current NCL, set at 350M ADA, has strong support with 76% of the voting stake participating. Nearly the entire voting stake approved it. Drastically reducing the NCL from 350M to 200M ADA would be either irresponsible or overly ambitious.\n\nWhat would happen next? Builders, Intersect, IOG, or others would likely submit a new governance action proposing an intermediate NCL, perhaps 250M or 300M ADA. Alternatively, multiple proposals could be submitted simultaneously.\n\nThis scenario would create an unstable environment that is counterproductive and difficult to support. Such instability undermines progress.\n\nMoreover, the crypto community has little interest in prolonged debates about how much the Cardano ecosystem can afford to invest.\n\nIn an unstable environment, even proposing a coherent budget becomes nearly impossible.\n\nCurrently, we have an NCL of 350M ADA. Consider this likely scenario:\n\nIntersect is expected to submit a governance action for the budget expiring in June. Meanwhile, if a new NCL of 200M ADA is approved by the end of May, the proposed budget would effectively become unconstitutional unless it is approved before the new NCL takes effect. \n\nThis complicates the process and further highlights the issues with sudden, extreme changes.\n\nDebating the NCL through governance actions is both inefficient and overly time-consuming.\n\nIt seems likely that the community's consensus would fall somewhere between 250M–300M ADA. However, no off-chain temperature check was conducted (to which the majority of the community would respond) before the on-chain vote, which led to the current NCL being approved simply to allow the budgeting process to continue.\n\nThe concept of the NCL itself is starting to feel unnecessary, as it constantly shifts based on the majority vote. If the voting stake agrees to increase or decrease the NCL, it will inevitably happen.\n\nIt’s important to emphasize that the NCL doesn’t dictate the amount that must be spent from the treasury. Every withdrawal proposal still requires approval from the community.\n\nI would likely vote YES if the current proposal fell within the 250M–300M ADA range. If a proposal like this is submitted, I would support it, as it aligns with the budget I consider reasonable based on the proposals I have endorsed.\n\nHowever, my decision isn’t final and may change depending on future developments in governance. \n\nFor instance, if governance actions combine multiple proposals that result in an excessively high total cost, or if the IOG proposal is grouped with several proposals I don’t support, or one I strongly oppose, such as the Daedalus 2025 Service Enhancement, I might reconsider my stance.\n\nIf the only way to prevent a poor budget outcome is to vote for a lower NCL, I am prepared to do so. This decision is nuanced and cannot be seen in black-and-white terms.\n\nI want to avoid a scenario where approving a lower NCL inevitably results in another GA submission.

          "text": "📘【SIPO Report】Cardano 2025 Budget Proposals – Round 1 (as of May 5, 2025)\n\nThis is an overview of the 40 proposals that passed, along with insights and future considerations from SIPO as a DRep.\n\n🧮【Overview】\n\n• Number of Proposals Passed: 40\n• Average Support Rate: Generally above 75% (Highest: 99.13%)\n• Total Allocated Budget: Over 100M ADA (Top 5 account for more than 60% of total)\n👇\nhttps://t.co/dKBcLUByY9\n\n🔍【5 Notable Characteristics Among the Passed Proposals】\n\n① Strengthening of L1/L2 Technical Infrastructure\nMidgard (Optimistic Rollups) / Starstream / zkFold/ Hydra Hexcore / Scalus / OpShin / UTxO RPC / Pallas, etc.\n👉 These were recognized as critical components of Cardano 2.0’s scalability strategy.\n\n② Maintenance and Enhancement of Infrastructure & Tools\nBlockfrost / PyCardano / Lucid / Dolos / Gerolamo\nAdaStat / Cexplorer / Eternl / Ledger App Rewrite\n👉 Investments were focused on developer-facing infrastructure and trusted tooling.\n\n③ Governance & Institutional Development\nIntersect / Catalyst 2025 / Beyond MVG / Builder DAO\n👉 Emphasis was placed on frameworks and participation infrastructure to support the Voltaire era.\n\n④ Real World Assets (RWA) & DeFi Connectivity\nTokenized Real Estate\n👉 While proposed, most financial tokenization and liquidity integration efforts lacked sufficient support.\n\n⑤ Web3 Use Cases & Community Initiatives\nContract Layer for Bitcoin / Global Events Strategy / Ecosystem Pavilion\n👉 While basic events were funded, only one BTC×Cardano proposal passed. There was generally little investment in tangible “real-world Cardano use” projects.\n\n📈【Top 5 Funded Proposals by Budget Allocation】\n\n• IOG Core Engineering: ₳96.82M (L1 Infrastructure)\n• Catalyst 2025: ₳69.46M (Governance Infrastructure)\n• Intersect: ₳20M (Organizational/Institutional Infrastructure)\n• TWEAG Proposal Series: ₳11.07M (Implementation/Haskell)\n• Cardano Summit 2025: ₳6M (Outreach & Events)\n\n※ The top 5 proposals alone represent over 60% of the total allocated budget, showing a concentration of investment.\n\n🧭【Summary of Adoption Trends】\n\nThis round’s outcomes were concentrated along two main axes, with a strong emphasis on technical infrastructure:\n\n✅ Expansion of Cardano’s technical foundation\n✅ Support for governance systems and organizational infrastructure\n\nIn contrast, proposals focusing on:\n• Real-world use cases\n• RealFi, UX, and liquidity connectivity\n• DAO-based governance\n\n• Education, culture, and media expansion\n\n…were largely passed over. Especially real-world applicability and RealFi remain key areas for potential reevaluation in future rounds.\n\n📘【Comparison to SIPO Voting】\n\nSIPO YES votes: 82 proposals\n→ Passed: 40 proposals (approx. 49%)\n\nAmong SIPO’s three pillars—“Infrastructure + Real-World Implementation + Institutional Design”:\n\n→ Infrastructure-focused proposals aligned strongly with overall DRep consensus\n→ Institutional proposals had mixed results\n→ Real-world use case proposals were mostly deferred\n\n❌【Trends Among Rejected SIPO-Supported Proposals】\n\nMany real-world use case proposals were likely seen as more suitable for Catalyst than the Treasury, due to lower short-term ROI visibility or measurable KPIs.\n\nThat said, these proposals form the conceptual foundation of a future decentralized societal OS.\n\nWe strongly encourage these projects to resubmit for Round 2 or 2026, especially as ecosystem maturity catches up with their ambition.\n\n🗳️ SIPO Voting Record:\n👇\nhttps://t.co/TdUryU1iVT\n\n📅【Upcoming Timeline】\n• Mid-May: Round 2 Ekklesia signaling opens (proposal updates allowed)\n• June: 2nd Budget Info Action → On-chain voting\n• Summer onward: Governance and budget process refinement for 2026 cycle\n\n🧭【SIPO’s Next Actions】\n• Monitor and publicly track progress of the 40 passed proposals\n• Support re-submission of rejected proposals in culture, education, and DAO areas\n• Continue publishing reports and recommendations on decentralized governance\n• Maintain focused voting on regional DAOs, real-world use, and public-good-oriented initiatives\n\nSIPO is committed not just to speaking of a decentralized future,\nbut to actively designing it—one vote at a time.\n🫡 Let’s build the chain people actually use.\n🧭 And the community that actually governs it.\n\nDRep ID:\ndrep1yffld2866p00cyg3ejjdewtvazgah7jjgk0s9m7m5ytmmdq33v3zh",

          "originalText": "📘【SIPO Report】Cardano 2025 Budget Proposals – Round 1 (as of May 5, 2025)\n\nThis is an overview of the 40 proposals that passed, along with insights and future considerations from SIPO as a DRep.\n\n🧮【Overview】\n\n• Number of Proposals Passed: 40\n• Average Support Rate: Generally above 75% (Highest: 99.13%)\n• Total Allocated Budget: Over 100M ADA (Top 5 account for more than 60% of total)\n👇\nhttps://t.co/dKBcLUByY9\n\n🔍【5 Notable Characteristics Among the Passed Proposals】\n\n① Strengthening of L1/L2 Technical Infrastructure\nMidgard (Optimistic Rollups) / Starstream / zkFold/ Hydra Hexcore / Scalus / OpShin / UTxO RPC / Pallas, etc.\n👉 These were recognized as critical components of Cardano 2.0’s scalability strategy.\n\n② Maintenance and Enhancement of Infrastructure & Tools\nBlockfrost / PyCardano / Lucid / Dolos / Gerolamo\nAdaStat / Cexplorer / Eternl / Ledger App Rewrite\n👉 Investments were focused on developer-facing infrastructure and trusted tooling.\n\n③ Governance & Institutional Development\nIntersect / Catalyst 2025 / Beyond MVG / Builder DAO\n👉 Emphasis was placed on frameworks and participation infrastructure to support the Voltaire era.\n\n④ Real World Assets (RWA) & DeFi Connectivity\nTokenized Real Estate\n👉 While proposed, most financial tokenization and liquidity integration efforts lacked sufficient support.\n\n⑤ Web3 Use Cases & Community Initiatives\nContract Layer for Bitcoin / Global Events Strategy / Ecosystem Pavilion\n👉 While basic events were funded, only one BTC×Cardano proposal passed. There was generally little investment in tangible “real-world Cardano use” projects.\n\n📈【Top 5 Funded Proposals by Budget Allocation】\n\n• IOG Core Engineering: ₳96.82M (L1 Infrastructure)\n• Catalyst 2025: ₳69.46M (Governance Infrastructure)\n• Intersect: ₳20M (Organizational/Institutional Infrastructure)\n• TWEAG Proposal Series: ₳11.07M (Implementation/Haskell)\n• Cardano Summit 2025: ₳6M (Outreach & Events)\n\n※ The top 5 proposals alone represent over 60% of the total allocated budget, showing a concentration of investment.\n\n🧭【Summary of Adoption Trends】\n\nThis round’s outcomes were concentrated along two main axes, with a strong emphasis on technical infrastructure:\n\n✅ Expansion of Cardano’s technical foundation\n✅ Support for governance systems and organizational infrastructure\n\nIn contrast, proposals focusing on:\n• Real-world use cases\n• RealFi, UX, and liquidity connectivity\n• DAO-based governance\n\n• Education, culture, and media expansion\n\n…were largely passed over. Especially real-world applicability and RealFi remain key areas for potential reevaluation in future rounds.\n\n📘【Comparison to SIPO Voting】\n\nSIPO YES votes: 82 proposals\n→ Passed: 40 proposals (approx. 49%)\n\nAmong SIPO’s three pillars—“Infrastructure + Real-World Implementation + Institutional Design”:\n\n→ Infrastructure-focused proposals aligned strongly with overall DRep consensus\n→ Institutional proposals had mixed results\n→ Real-world use case proposals were mostly deferred\n\n❌【Trends Among Rejected SIPO-Supported Proposals】\n\nMany real-world use case proposals were likely seen as more suitable for Catalyst than the Treasury, due to lower short-term ROI visibility or measurable KPIs.\n\nThat said, these proposals form the conceptual foundation of a future decentralized societal OS.\n\nWe strongly encourage these projects to resubmit for Round 2 or 2026, especially as ecosystem maturity catches up with their ambition.\n\n🗳️ SIPO Voting Record:\n👇\nhttps://t.co/TdUryU1iVT\n\n📅【Upcoming Timeline】\n• Mid-May: Round 2 Ekklesia signaling opens (proposal updates allowed)\n• June: 2nd Budget Info Action → On-chain voting\n• Summer onward: Governance and budget process refinement for 2026 cycle\n\n🧭【SIPO’s Next Actions】\n• Monitor and publicly track progress of the 40 passed proposals\n• Support re-submission of rejected proposals in culture, education, and DAO areas\n• Continue publishing reports and recommendations on decentralized governance\n• Maintain focused voting on regional DAOs, real-world use, and public-good-oriented initiatives\n\nSIPO is committed not just to speaking of a decentralized future,\nbut to actively designing it—one vote at a time.\n🫡 Let’s build the chain people actually use.\n🧭 And the community that actually governs it.\n\nDRep ID:\ndrep1yffld2866p00cyg3ejjdewtvazgah7jjgk0s9m7m5ytmmdq33v3zh"

      "title": "Cardano Treasury DeFi Liquidity Budget",
      "abstract": "The goal of this proposal is to increase liquidity on Cardano, specifically by supporting stablecoin liquidity. 50,000,000 ADA is requested over the course of 12 months (the duration of the budget) to support the Cardano decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. The majority of the funds in this budget will be disbursed to DeFi protocols including decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and lending protocols to help seed liquidity on Cardano. The funds are managed by a 7 person administrating committee composed of publicly identified individuals who are part of multi-signature (multisig) wallet from which liquidity will be managed. This budget is proposed independent of other efforts since the goal of this budget is not to pay developers or companies for ecosystem improvements, rather to increase liquidity in the system overall. Further, unlike other proposals this budget serves as a revenue stream for the Cardano treasury since yields from DeFi protocols will be sent back to the Cardano treasury.",
      "content": "### Constitutionality of the Budget\n\n**Purpose**: This proposal is for work intended to enhance the long term sustainability of Cardano by increasing stablecoin liquidity in the ecosystem.\n\n**Article III(5)**: This proposal fulfills this section of the Cardano Constitution by containing a Title, Abstract, Reason for Proposal (Motivation and Rationale), and Supporting Materials. An off-chain copy of this proposal can be found at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theeldermillenial/2025-liquidity-budget/refs/heads/master/info.jsonld, and the document hash is attached to the transaction to fulfill the other requirements of this section. An easy to read version can be found at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theeldermillenial/2025-liquidity-budget/refs/heads/master/README.md\n\n**Article IV(1)**: We propose that this budget span 73 epochs (roughly 1 calendar year).\n\n**Article IV(2)**: Disbursements for this budget must be made to a multi-signature (multisig) wallet composed of at least seven independent administrating members with at 4 of 7 signing policy. The process of overseeing funds then requires 4 of the 7 independent administrating members agree to disbursement of funds to DeFi protocols. The wallet must be the owner of any liquidity deposited into DeFi protocols, meaning liquidity tokens or any other assurance of liquidity must be held in the multisig wallet and should not be delegated to a third party, except as required for conversion of assets to fiat or minting of stablecoins. With this design, the committee will be the administrator of the budget funds and will directly oversee distribution of funds to protocols.\n\n**Article IV(3)**: At the time of submission, the NCL is currently at 350 million ADA and there is only one budget requesting 1.5 million ADA that has been submitted on chain through an info action. We believe that this removes a potential constitutional barrier for this proposal based on Article IV(3), since this proposal requests 50 million ADA of the potential remaining 348.5 million ADA.\n\n**Article IV(4)**: We budget 2,000 ADA/month (24,000 ADA total) to cover the costs of audits and transparency. The building of a dashboard and quarterly reporting in the proposed work also fulfill the obligations of this section. Since all funds will be managed from a single account, including all liquidity holdings and disbursement of monthly stipends for administrating committee members, we believe the dashboard and monthly reports are sufficient for auditing. To further strengthen our commitment to the auditing requirement, we also commit to any community driven requests for independent audits via an Info Action, and will use funds up to the $50,000/month budget to work with an independent auditor.\n\n**Article IV(5)**: The nature of the proposed work fulfills the first requirement of Article IV(5) of the constitution. The holding of all assets in the multisig account composed of 7 independent signers improves the ability of the Cardano community to easily audit and track actions taken by the committee.

The funds are managed by a 7 person administrating committee composed of publicly identified individuals who are part of multi-signature (multisig) wallet from which liquidity will be managed. This budget is proposed independent of other efforts since the goal of this budget is not to pay developers or companies for ecosystem improvements, rather to increase liquidity in the system overall. Further, unlike other proposals this budget serves as a revenue stream for the Cardano treasury since yields from DeFi protocols will be sent back to the Cardano treasury.",
          "rationale": "### Constitutionality of the Budget\n\n**Purpose**: This proposal is for work intended to enhance the long term sustainability of Cardano by increasing stablecoin liquidity in the ecosystem.\n\n**Article III(5)**: This proposal fulfills this section of the Cardano Constitution by containing a Title, Abstract, Reason for Proposal (Motivation and Rationale), and Supporting Materials. An off-chain copy of this proposal can be found at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theeldermillenial/2025-liquidity-budget/refs/heads/master/info.jsonld, and the document hash is attached to the transaction to fulfill the other requirements of this section. An easy to read version can be found at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theeldermillenial/2025-liquidity-budget/refs/heads/master/README.md\n\n**Article IV(1)**: We propose that this budget span 73 epochs (roughly 1 calendar year).\n\n**Article IV(2)**: Disbursements for this budget must be made to a multi-signature (multisig) wallet composed of at least seven independent administrating members with at 4 of 7 signing policy. The process of overseeing funds then requires 4 of the 7 independent administrating members agree to disbursement of funds to DeFi protocols. The wallet must be the owner of any liquidity deposited into DeFi protocols, meaning liquidity tokens or any other assurance of liquidity must be held in the multisig wallet and should not be delegated to a third party, except as required for conversion of assets to fiat or minting of stablecoins. With this design, the committee will be the administrator of the budget funds and will directly oversee distribution of funds to protocols.\n\n**Article IV(3)**: At the time of submission, the NCL is currently at 350 million ADA and there is only one budget requesting 1.5 million ADA that has been submitted on chain through an info action. We believe that this removes a potential constitutional barrier for this proposal based on Article IV(3), since this proposal requests 50 million ADA of the potential remaining 348.5 million ADA.\n\n**Article IV(4)**: We budget 2,000 ADA/month (24,000 ADA total) to cover the costs of audits and transparency. The building of a dashboard and quarterly reporting in the proposed work also fulfill the obligations of this section. Since all funds will be managed from a single account, including all liquidity holdings and disbursement of monthly stipends for administrating committee members, we believe the dashboard and monthly reports are sufficient for auditing. To further strengthen our commitment to the auditing requirement, we also commit to any community driven requests for independent audits via an Info Action, and will use funds up to the $50,000/month budget to work with an independent auditor.\n\n**Article IV(5)**: The nature of the proposed work fulfills the first requirement of Article IV(5) of the constitution. The holding of all assets in the multisig account composed of 7 independent signers improves the ability of the Cardano community to easily audit and track actions taken by the committee. To fulfill the second part of the section, funds will not be delegated to an SPO and will be delegated to the predefined auto-abstain voting option.\n\n**TREASURY-04a**: There is not on chain withdrawal action for this budget, and one will not be submitted unless this budget achieves the necessary 50% approval.",
          "motivation": "### High Level Overview\n\n* **Amount** - The Cardano treasury should dedicate 3.33% of treasury funds (50 million ada) to purchasing fiat backed stablecoins, spread out over 12 monthly purchases. The committee should make every effort to help mitigate the potential price impact of converting ADA to fiat to mint as stable coins over the 12 month period. Note that up to 35% of funds may be held in ADA to pair with ADA/Stablecoin pairs on DEXs, which will help to alleviate price impact concerns.\n* **Administration** - A 7 person administrating committee will manage the treasury reserve using a multisig wallet (4 of 7 signature validation) to hold and deploy funds to protocols. The administrating committee will be responsible for working with stablecoin issuers to convert ADA to fiat backed stablecoins and deploying liquidity. A specific focus of the administrating committee will be analyzing approaches of deploying ADA to stablecoins in a way that minimizes ADA price impact.\n* **Revenue** - Deployed funds will increase in value according to the interest and fees defined by the protocols fees are disbursed to. Each month the total interest generated by the deployed liquidity will be calculated and 15% of accumulated interest from protocols will be withdrawn from the respective protocols and sent back to the treasury, while the remaining 85% of accumulated interest will remain in the protocol (e.g. analagous but not identical to compounding interest). ADA held by the committee that is not deployed will not be staked according to constitutional requirements (see Rationale for more information).\n* **Deployment** - DeFi protocols with at least 250,000 ADA worth of a stablecoin may apply to be recipients of minted stablecoin, and the administrating committee will review and disburse funds to protocols that have the best plans for growth and returns back to the treasury. A maximum of 2 or 3 protocols may be used per DeFi category to help minimize fragmentation. Applicants should make a strong case for the use of their protocol, including a a description of historical success, security, dedicated support for handling issues, and features of the protocol that will maximize the value to the Cardano treasury if liquidity is deployed to the protocol. New protocols will not be excluded for having limited history, but must make a strong case in other areas of the application.\n* **Strategy** - The committee will deploy funds on a monthly basis in a way that minimizes ADA price impact and fees. A specific focus should be on deployment of liquidity that can be \"passively\" managed, meaning frequent adjustements are not needed. The focus on passive management is to help ease the management strategy and reduce the fees incurred by managing liquidity. This may be changed in the future by an on chain Info Action.\n* **Audits and Transparency** - The committee is responsible for creating a monthly report or building a dashboard (or both) to describe the ADA held in reserve, the funds deployed to protocols, and all fees and other costs associated with managing the treasury. The committee may use part of the monthly budget to develop a dashboard to provide live updates of the stablecoin reserve for the Cardano community.\n* **Costs** - Each member of the committee will be compensated $2,000/month in the fiat backed stablecoin of their choice ($14,000/month total for all committee members). The stablecoin reserve fund will cover the costs of minting fiat backed stables, deployment of liquidity to protocols, and rebalancing if needed. The committe will also use some funds to perform KYB/KYC of 3rd parties as needed as well as cover costs for creation of a legal entity to house the fund. Total costs per month should be capped at $50,000/month over the 12 month period. Any costs that extend beyond the budget period should be deducted from the accrued interest.\n* **Organization** - Part of the initial budget will be used to investigate proper incorporation of a legal entity to house the funds being managed for this budget. Every reasonable attempt should be made to house the fund in a non-profit to maximize tax benefits as well as provide future opportunities for organizations to donate to the fund.\n* **Revisions** - Since this fund may exist in perpetuity due to funds not being directly spent, it is important to have a mechanism for modification up to and including returning all funds back to the treasury. To this end, any member of the Cardano community may submit an Info Action to modify any aspect of this budget including members of the committee, monthly budget limits, committee pay, and returning some or all of funds back to the treasury. All members of the committee must commit to following any on chain Info Action that is passed by 67% of the community vote. If a committee member does not feel they can continue with their duties at any time, they must continue to carry out their duties until a suitable replacement is found according to the impeachment and replacement mechanisms described below.\n\n### Governing Committee\n\n#### Term Limits\n\nCommunity members have a maximum term limit of 2 years, after which they can re-apply for a second 2 year term. A minimum of 4 community members (not affiliated with founding entities) must be on the committee at all times.\n\nFounding entities may have at most 1 person each on the committee. There are no term limits for committee members that represent a founding entity, but must still abide by the removal process of an Info Action or a majority vote of the other committee members.\n\n#### Retirement and Impeachment\n\nIn the event that a committee member retires or their signing keys are exposed, the remaining members of the committee must create a new multisig address with the same policy (4 of 7) that removes the retired address. This process also gives the committee the capacity to impeach inactive members of the committee, as well as the ability for the community to impeach one or more members through an info action.\n\n#### Community Feedback\n\nThe administrating committee members should make themselves available to feedback and questions from the Cardano community, and make attempts to make changes that incorporate reasonable feedback from the community. Feedback can be received through a Telegram channel, on Twitter, scheduled town hall meetings not more than once per month. The administrating committee should make attempts to incorporate feedback from the Cardano community, but are not obligated to do so. If the administrating committee does not respond or refuses to incorporate changes, the Cardano community may submit an on chain Info Action (that achieves 67% approval) to compel the committee to make changes up to and including removal of one or more members and/or returning some or all funds back to the treasury.\n\n#### People\n\nBelow are 6 of the 7 members of the initial administrating committee. They range in experience and background to help ensure the long term success and sustainability of the stablecoin liquidity. There is an ongoing search for a 7th member of the committee and will be included in the withdrawal action.\n\n1.

        "summary": "The 'Cardano Treasury DeFi Liquidity Budget' proposal requests 50 million ADA from the Cardano Treasury, to be disbursed over 12 months, with the primary goal of increasing liquidity within Cardano's DeFi ecosystem, particularly for stablecoins. It will be managed by a 7-person committee using a multisig wallet. A key feature is its aim to generate yield from these DeFi activities, with a portion (15%) returned to the Treasury monthly. This initiative is presented against the backdrop of Cardano's strategic need to boost its DeFi sector's Total Value Locked (TVL) and overall activity to remain competitive. The proposal asserts its constitutionality and details mechanisms for fund deployment, revenue sharing, cost management, and committee governance.",
        "myOpinion": "I oppose the 'Cardano Treasury DeFi Liquidity Budget' proposal in its current iteration. While the strategic objective to enhance Cardano's DeFi liquidity  is crucial for its competitiveness and aligns with the need to evolve its ecosystem, the 50 million ADA request is substantial and the proposal, as it stands, has critical gaps in transparency, operational specifics, and robust governance oversight. The concerns raised by DReps regarding vagueness in decision-making processes, stablecoin selection strategy, market maker engagement, and mechanisms to prevent value leakage (e.g., protocol fees on treasury funds) are significant. Furthermore, the risk of negative ADA price impact from large-scale conversions requires a more detailed mitigation plan than a general commitment to manage it. A more prudent approach would involve a smaller, clearly defined pilot program or an info-action to allow the community and DReps to collaboratively refine the operational framework, ensuring accountability and maximizing the long-term strategic benefit to Cardano. Paying a premium for good engineering and sound financial stewardship means such large treasury deployments must be meticulously planned and transparently governed to ensure sustainability and true ecosystem enhancement."

I expect revenue to be higher (about 320M ADA), so we will likely save ADA for the next few years.\n\nBeing in a bull market, it is advantageous to invest more for several reasons. \n\nAs the market price of ADA increases, getting a higher dollar value with a smaller amount of ADA coins becomes possible. \n\nAdditionally, smart investments can attract new users to the ecosystem.

The cost would be around 140M USD, which translates to about 140M ADA if the average price of ADA throughout the bull market is 1 USD. \n\nHowever, if the average price of ADA were higher, say 2 USD, the cost in the ADA value would be half as much. The budget calculates that 1 ADA is 0.5 USD. That doesn't seem adequate to me.\n\nThis is a topic we should discuss and consider.\n\nCan the current budget be reduced? Can we allocate ADA differently?\n\nI don’t want to criticize the high costs line by line without knowing all the details. I’ll use common sense. \n\nFeel free to correct me or provide important context.\n\nOn-chain governance seems excessively expensive to me. While DReps can vote on governance actions, Intersect and various committees will cost us tens of millions of ADA. \n\nWith such a high budget, we risk depleting a significant amount of ADA in the treasury during the next bear market.\n\nThe costs of the Budget Committee also seem high. Some processes could be more cost-effective. Do we really need a Budget Summit? DReps can meet at the Cardano Summit (see below).\n\nAllocating 20M ADA for IntersectMBO seems like a lot. \n\nWhen I looked at the individual items, the total was 2.7M ADA. Perhaps I am misunderstanding something.\n\nRegarding the Product Committee category, the costs appear high, especially for items that we may not need or that I believe were already ready.\n\nIf I'm not mistaken, the multi-resource consensus Minotaur is being built for Midnight, not Cardano. The same applies to Proof of Useful Work.\n\nI would like to focus primarily on scalability, ZK technology, L2s, and other technologies that Cardano needs as soon as possible. Some items in the budget can wait.\n\nI would like to see a budget linked to the roadmap. We need the strategy first. Then make the roadmap and link it with the budget.\n\nThe largest costs in the budget relate to the Technical Steering Committee. Core Maintenance will cost us 40M ADA. This seems like a huge expense and is worth investigating in more detail.\n\nIn the 80M ADA allocated for the Membership & Community Committee, 60M ADA is for three Catalyst Funds. This leaves us with 20M ADA to discuss. \n\nI have never heard of Community Hubs. I know there were proposals to create various hubs in Catalyst, and some were funded. Do we really need to invest 3.2M ADA in the Community Hub?\n\n11.2M ADA is allocated for The Civic Committee. This includes compensation for committee members and DReps. \n\n1.8M ADA is allocated for DReps, which is roughly 0.5% of the total budget. While the prevailing opinion is that DReps should work for free, I believe using 0.5% of the budget for their rewards is reasonable. DReps and committee members deserve some compensation.\n\nDReps decide on the budget. They can save ADA or better direct the budget.\n\nA topic worth discussing is whether DReps should be more involved in internal processes. DReps are elected by the community, and if they are interested, they should be members of committees and participate in tasks like compiling the budget. \n\nPerhaps only those DReps who are more involved in these processes should be paid.\n\nI would halve the 20M ADA allocated for the Growth & Marketing Committee. Cardano needs to invest in technology, not marketing. I more or less agree with the items in the Growth section.\n\n3.1M ADA is the cost for Cardano Summit 2026. I would agree with that and link it directly to other meetings, such as the DReps meeting and the debate on the next budget.\n\nI would definitely not pay influencers. I don't believe this type of marketing works.\n\nI approve of 3.8M ADA for the Open Source Committee and would gladly increase the budget if possible, provided we save money elsewhere.\n\nDespite my reservations about the budget and my efforts to reduce some costs, I might be willing to approve the budget. I'm not sure yet. I would like to see some changes.\n\nThe budget will still change based on community input, so please comment on the Cardano Forum.\n\nMy opinion is that we should save on marketing, maybe on Community Hubs, development of technologies that Cardano does not need in the next 2 years, and other items and rather mint stablecoins.\n\nEveryone will have a different opinion on the budget. It will be difficult to find consensus in a decentralized environment. Therefore, I will tend to approve the budget unless I find a fundamental problem. I will continue to examine the budget and comment on it if needed.\n\nI am curious about the final version.",

A prudent economist aims to ensure expenses remain below revenues while also building reserves for the future.\n\nPersonally, I would prefer an NCL of 280M ADA for 2025 and 230M ADA for 2026. That said, I recognize that during a bull market, we can afford to allocate more funds—potentially even using Treasury resources to buy stablecoins.\n\nFor Cardano to thrive, it must remain in the top 10 blockchain platforms in the coming years and stay competitive. Achieving this requires consistent investment, particularly in scalability.\n\nFrom a long-term perspective, Cardano must also prepare for resistance against quantum computers. This will demand significant investment over the next decade, which needs to be factored into current planning.\n\nThe Intersect budget is estimated at 260M ADA—lower than the proposed NCL. I believe this budget can be reduced; however, even if it isn't, it will remain within the limits set by this GA. Therefore, the NCL will not hinder ecosystem funding.\n\nI propose utilizing the Treasury to mint stablecoins within the Cardano ecosystem, which could generate yield and serve as an additional revenue stream. At present, ADA fee revenue does not meet expectations, and diversifying income sources is critical.\n\nYield generation could also be redistributed as staking rewards. If ADA could capture the success of the Cardano ecosystem, it could have a positive impact on the market capitalization.\n\nThese are the reasons I advocate for setting the NCL above the Intersect budget.\n\nHowever, I do acknowledge the risks. If a new NCL is not approved for 2027, the last approved NCL—250M ADA—will remain in effect. This could result in spending exceeding Treasury income that year. Nevertheless, I am confident the community will successfully ratify a new NCL when the time comes.\n\nIn my opinion, the NCL should be calculated as a percentage of Treasury income from the previous year. \n\nFor instance, if Treasury income totaled 300M ADA during the last 73 epochs and the NCL was set at 90%, the spending limit would be 270M ADA.\n\nImportant monetary parameters are currently defined as percentages, and it would be wise to maintain this convention.

I do not intend to promote my own perspective by rejecting other Governance Actions.\n\nI appreciate that this GA originates from the community rather than from founding entities. It is encouraging to see the community assuming greater responsibility.\n\nThe proposed NCLs for the next two years are reasonable and align with long-term sustainability. It is crucial not to delay investments in ecosystem development. The sooner we approve the NCL, the better.\n\nDisclaimer: If an alternative GA proposing a different NCL emerges and aligns more closely with my views, I may reconsider my vote.

          "text": "Early voting Intention announcement on: \"2025 Net Change Limit\" governance info action: ❌\n\n🚨If you are delegating to me, please redelegate to someone who wants to vote YES or ABSTAIN 🚨\n\nI welcome the proposed Net Change Limit proposal. The proposers have stated that from January 5th, 2024, Epoch 459, through December 30th, Epoch 531, the actual total income into the Cardano Treasury was 335,957,093 ada.\n\nThe proposed NCL is 350M ada. This is roughly 14M ada higher than the total income in the Cardano Treasury for 2024. I welcome the proposed reference to modelling and the reference to a previous period for which we have data. \n\nThe motion uses modelling of ADA inflow for the previous year as the main basis for approving an NCL. It is indeed one of the factors that must be considered.\n \nWhat I am missing in this proposal - as it proposes a relatively large NCL - is even a minor economic analysis of how approvals of different NCLs could impact the valuation of ADA. An NCL of 350M ADA is sending a signal to the market. What is this signal? \n\nHow does it compare to previous signals?

The proposers have stated that from January 5th, 2024, Epoch 459, through December 30th, Epoch 531, the actual total income into the Cardano Treasury was 335,957,093 ada.\n\nThe proposed NCL is 350M ada. This is roughly 14M ada higher than the total income in the Cardano Treasury for 2024. I welcome the proposed reference to modelling and the reference to a previous period for which we have data. \n\nThe motion uses modelling of ADA inflow for the previous year as the main basis for approving an NCL. It is indeed one of the factors that must be considered.\n \nWhat I am missing in this proposal - as it proposes a relatively large NCL - is even a minor economic analysis of how approvals of different NCLs could impact the valuation of ADA. An NCL of 350M ADA is sending a signal to the market. What is this signal? \n\nHow does it compare to previous signals?

          "text": "@JaromirTesar \n\nScalability and Funding - Plan is still the same.  Last I checked both Midgard and IOG teams are still making good progress on things, despite the fact that we have not withdrawn from the Cardano treasury in a very long time.  I don't think another 6 weeks while we pursue a better will slow progress meaningfully.\n\nCatalyst Funding - I'm not aware of these ecosystem teams that are \"fighting for survival\".  Catalyst has already been funded up through F13.  And how would any of these projects know that they would be approved for funding anyways?  IMHO a 6-week delay is perfectly fine.\n\nFlexibility of Governance - I'm aware that a new NCL can be passed that is lower.  However, I worry that once we have a high NCL passed, many of the top dReps who happen to have budget proposals will rigorously defend the high limit so that their proposals have a better chance.  Better to approve a low NCL and then raise it later if we have to IMHO.\n\nMarket Timing and Investment Windows - I don't think any of the budget proposals mentioned so far move the needle enough in a positive direction to be worth the ADA they are asking for.  What is the PMF we are trying to market?  What strategic initiatives other than ones in IOG's core proposal, Midgard, Starstream, Amaru, and Gerolamo are needed?  All of those combined are still less than 200M ADA.  Also, I support a stablecoin liquidity proposal, but it needs to be decoupled from Emurgo's omnibus proposal IMHO.\n\nChecks and Balances - The issue here is not necessarily that dReps will want to spend up to the cap.  It's that budget proposers will.  We don't have enough visibility into ANY of the proposals' true costs.  Example:  Maybe with a 150M NCL, IOG might propose 50M for their core proposal.  With 350M NCL, there is enough room for them to ask for 100M first just to see if it passes.  We WANT budget proposers to be *LIMITED* by the NCL to get them to compete to lower costs.\n\nMisuse Isn’t Solved by NCL Alone - Agreed.  But IMHO lowering the NCL will cause proposers to increase the *quality* of their proposals in order to compete with other proposers for a slice of a smaller pie.\n\nSelling Pressure and Timing - ADA is currently 5x below ATH.  I very much doubt that it will be on its way back down again 6 weeks from now.  In fact I think if we delay a little bit we'll be more likely to stretch the value of our ADA spent to go much further.\n\nThese are some of the main reasons I am strongly against approving a 350M NCL right now.",

          "originalText": "@JaromirTesar \n\nScalability and Funding - Plan is still the same.  Last I checked both Midgard and IOG teams are still making good progress on things, despite the fact that we have not withdrawn from the Cardano treasury in a very long time.  I don't think another 6 weeks while we pursue a better will slow progress meaningfully.\n\nCatalyst Funding - I'm not aware of these ecosystem teams that are \"fighting for survival\".  Catalyst has already been funded up through F13.  And how would any of these projects know that they would be approved for funding anyways?  IMHO a 6-week delay is perfectly fine.\n\nFlexibility of Governance - I'm aware that a new NCL can be passed that is lower.  However, I worry that once we have a high NCL passed, many of the top dReps who happen to have budget proposals will rigorously defend the high limit so that their proposals have a better chance.  Better to approve a low NCL and then raise it later if we have to IMHO.\n\nMarket Timing and Investment Windows - I don't think any of the budget proposals mentioned so far move the needle enough in a positive direction to be worth the ADA they are asking for.  What is the PMF we are trying to market?  What strategic initiatives other than ones in IOG's core proposal, Midgard, Starstream, Amaru, and Gerolamo are needed?  All of those combined are still less than 200M ADA.  Also, I support a stablecoin liquidity proposal, but it needs to be decoupled from Emurgo's omnibus proposal IMHO.\n\nChecks and Balances - The issue here is not necessarily that dReps will want to spend up to the cap.  It's that budget proposers will.  We don't have enough visibility into ANY of the proposals' true costs.  Example:  Maybe with a 150M NCL, IOG might propose 50M for their core proposal.  With 350M NCL, there is enough room for them to ask for 100M first just to see if it passes.  We WANT budget proposers to be *LIMITED* by the NCL to get them to compete to lower costs.\n\nMisuse Isn’t Solved by NCL Alone - Agreed.  But IMHO lowering the NCL will cause proposers to increase the *quality* of their proposals in order to compete with other proposers for a slice of a smaller pie.\n\nSelling Pressure and Timing - ADA is currently 5x below ATH.  I very much doubt that it will be on its way back down again 6 weeks from now.  In fact I think if we delay a little bit we'll be more likely to stretch the value of our ADA spent to go much further.\n\nThese are some of the main reasons I am strongly against approving a 350M NCL right now."

          "text": "Stable coin proposal full version below:\n\nAbstract\nThe goal of this proposal is to increase liquidity on Cardano, specifically by supporting stablecoin liquidity. 50,000,000 ADA is requested over the course of 12 months (the duration of the budget) to support the Cardano decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. The majority of the funds in this budget will be disbursed to DeFi protocols including decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and lending protocols to help seed liquidity on Cardano. The funds are managed by a 7 person administrating committee composed of publicly identified individuals who are part of multi-signature (multisig) wallet from which liquidity will be managed. This budget is proposed independent of other efforts since the goal of this budget is not to pay developers or companies for ecosystem improvements, rather to increase liquidity in the system overall. Further, unlike other proposals this budget serves as a revenue stream for the Cardano treasury since yields from DeFi protocols will be sent back to the Cardano treasury.\n\nMotivation\nHigh Level Overview\nAmount - The Cardano treasury should dedicate 3.33% of treasury funds (50 million ada) to purchasing fiat backed stablecoins, spread out over 12 monthly purchases. The committee should make every effort to help mitigate the potential price impact of converting ADA to fiat to mint as stable coins over the 12 month period. Note that up to 35% of funds may be held in ADA to pair with ADA/Stablecoin pairs on DEXs, which will help to alleviate price impact concerns.\nAdministration - A 7 person administrating committee will manage the treasury reserve using a multisig wallet (4 of 7 signature validation) to hold and deploy funds to protocols. The administrating committee will be responsible for working with stablecoin issuers to convert ADA to fiat backed stablecoins and deploying liquidity. A specific focus of the administrating committee will be analyzing approaches of deploying ADA to stablecoins in a way that minimizes ADA price impact.\nRevenue - Deployed funds will increase in value according to the interest and fees defined by the protocols fees are disbursed to. Each month the total interest generated by the deployed liquidity will be calculated and 15% of accumulated interest from protocols will be withdrawn from the respective protocols and sent back to the treasury, while the remaining 85% of accumulated interest will remain in the protocol (e.g. analagous but not identical to compounding interest). ADA held by the committee that is not deployed will not be staked according to constitutional requirements (see Rationale for more information).\nDeployment - DeFi protocols with at least 250,000 ADA worth of a stablecoin may apply to be recipients of minted stablecoin, and the administrating committee will review and disburse funds to protocols that have the best plans for growth and returns back to the treasury. A maximum of 2 or 3 protocols may be used per DeFi category to help minimize fragmentation. Applicants should make a strong case for the use of their protocol, including a a description of historical success, security, dedicated support for handling issues, and features of the protocol that will maximize the value to the Cardano treasury if liquidity is deployed to the protocol. New protocols will not be excluded for having limited history, but must make a strong case in other areas of the application.\nStrategy - The committee will deploy funds on a monthly basis in a way that minimizes ADA price impact and fees. A specific focus should be on deployment of liquidity that can be \"passively\" managed, meaning frequent adjustements are not needed. The focus on passive management is to help ease the management strategy and reduce the fees incurred by managing liquidity. This may be changed in the future by an on chain Info Action.\nAudits and Transparency - The committee is responsible for creating a monthly report or building a dashboard (or both) to describe the ADA held in reserve, the funds deployed to protocols, and all fees and other costs associated with managing the treasury. The committee may use part of the monthly budget to develop a dashboard to provide live updates of the stablecoin reserve for the Cardano community.\nCosts - Each member of the committee will be compensated $2,000/month in the fiat backed stablecoin of their choice ($14,000/month total for all committee members). The stablecoin reserve fund will cover the costs of minting fiat backed stables, deployment of liquidity to protocols, and rebalancing if needed. The committe will also use some funds to perform KYB/KYC of 3rd parties as needed as well as cover costs for creation of a legal entity to house the fund. Total costs per month should be capped at $50,000/month over the 12 month period. Any costs that extend beyond the budget period should be deducted from the accrued interest.\nOrganization - Part of the initial budget will be used to investigate proper incorporation of a legal entity to house the funds being managed for this budget. Every reasonable attempt should be made to house the fund in a non-profit to maximize tax benefits as well as provide future opportunities for organizations to donate to the fund.\nRevisions - Since this fund may exist in perpetuity due to funds not being directly spent, it is important to have a mechanism for modification up to and including returning all funds back to the treasury. To this end, any member of the Cardano community may submit an Info Action to modify any aspect of this budget including members of the committee, monthly budget limits, committee pay, and returning some or all of funds back to the treasury. All members of the committee must commit to following any on chain Info Action that is passed by 67% of the community vote. If a committee member does not feel they can continue with their duties at any time, they must continue to carry out their duties until a suitable replacement is found according to the impeachment and replacement mechanisms described below.\nGoverning Committee\nTerm Limits\nCommunity members have a maximum term limit of 2 years, after which they can re-apply for a second 2 year term. A minimum of 4 community members (not affiliated with founding entities) must be on the committee at all times.\n\nFounding entities may have at most 1 person each on the committee. There are no term limits for committee members that represent a founding entity, but must still abide by the removal process of an Info Action or a majority vote of the other committee members.\n\nRetirement and Impeachment\nIn the event that a committee member retires or their signing keys are exposed, the remaining members of the committee must create a new multisig address with the same policy (4 of 7) that removes the retired address. This process also gives the committee the capacity to impeach inactive members of the committee, as well as the ability for the community to impeach one or more members through an info action.\n\nCommunity Feedback\nThe administrating committee members should make themselves available to feedback and questions from the Cardano community, and make attempts to make changes that incorporate reasonable feedback from the community. Feedback can be received through a Telegram channel, on Twitter, scheduled town hall meetings not more than once per month. The administrating committee should make attempts to incorporate feedback from the Cardano community, but are not obligated to do so. If the administrating committee does not respond or refuses to incorporate changes, the Cardano community may submit an on chain Info Action (that achieves 67% approval) to compel the committee to make changes up to and including removal of one or more members and/or returning some or all funds back to the treasury.\n\nPeople\nBelow are 6 of the 7 members of the initial administrating committee. They range in experience and background to help ensure the long term success and sustainability of the stablecoin liquidity. There is an ongoing search for a 7th member of the committee and will be included in the withdrawal action.\n\nLinda Roland (aka CryptoFly)Twitter - @cryptofly777\nYouTube - https://t.co/FbNtOdQ1ML\nAbout - Linda Roland is the operator of MALU Pool and has been actively contributing to the Cardano ecosystem since 2021.

An off-chain copy of this proposal can be found at https://t.co/uJRvuGJ3SG, and the document hash is attached to the transaction to fulfill the other requirements of this section.\nArticle IV(1): We propose that this budget span 73 epochs (roughly 1 calendar year).\nArticle IV(2): Disbursements for this budget must be made to a multi-signature (multisig) wallet composed of at least seven independent administrating members with at 4 of 7 signing policy. The process of overseeing funds then requires 4 of the 7 independent administrating members agree to disbursement of funds to DeFi protocols. The wallet must be the owner of any liquidity deposited into DeFi protocols, meaning liquidity tokens or any other assurance of liquidity must be held in the multisig wallet and should not be delegated to a third party, except as required for conversion of assets to fiat or minting of stablecoins. With this design, the committee will be the administrator of the budget funds and will directly oversee distribution of funds to protocols.\nArticle IV(3): At the time of submission, the NCL is currently at 350 million ADA and there is only one budget requesting 1.5 million ADA that has been submitted on chain through an info action. We believe that this removes a potential constitutional barrier for this proposal based on Article IV(3), since this proposal requests 50 million ADA of the potential remaining 348.5 million ADA.\nArticle IV(4): We budget 2,000 ADA/month (24,000 ADA total) to cover the costs of audits and transparency. The building of a dashboard and quarterly reporting in the proposed work also fulfill the obligations of this section. Since all funds will be managed from a single account, including all liquidity holdings and disbursement of monthly stipends for administrating committee members, we believe the dashboard and monthly reports are sufficient for auditing. To further strengthen our commitment to the auditing requirement, we also commit to any community driven requests for independent audits via an Info Action, and will use funds up to the $50,000/month budget to work with an independent auditor.\nArticle IV(5): The nature of the proposed work fulfills the first requirement of Article IV(5) of the constitution. The holding of all assets in the multisig account composed of 7 independent signers improves the ability of the Cardano community to easily audit and track actions taken by the committee. To fulfill the second part of the section, funds will not be delegated to an SPO and will be delegated to the predefined auto-abstain voting option.\nTREASURY-04a: There is not on chain withdrawal action for this budget, and one will not be submitted unless this budget achieves the necessary 50% approval. @ElderM @Marco_112358 @ESCOweb3 @palmeconomy @nbxcom @planetmaaz here is the link on govtools https://t.co/PVhnhZyXTF",

          "originalText": "Stable coin proposal full version below:\n\nAbstract\nThe goal of this proposal is to increase liquidity on Cardano, specifically by supporting stablecoin liquidity. 50,000,000 ADA is requested over the course of 12 months (the duration of the budget) to support the Cardano decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. The majority of the funds in this budget will be disbursed to DeFi protocols including decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and lending protocols to help seed liquidity on Cardano. The funds are managed by a 7 person administrating committee composed of publicly identified individuals who are part of multi-signature (multisig) wallet from which liquidity will be managed.

It’s based on a 2024 treasury income model (approx. 336M ADA) and now serves as the foundation for current budget deliberations.\n\n❌ Rejected: A more conservative proposal to cap 2025 at 300M ADA and 2026 at 250M ADA was not approved.\n\n🟠 Under Review:\n“2025 Cardano NCL” proposes lowering the NCL to 200M ADA, urging a cautious approach during this first year of decentralized treasury governance.\n“300M ADA for Epochs 563–635” aims to establish an NCL for early 2026, supporting budget continuity across overlapping periods.\n\nMeanwhile, several new funding proposals have been submitted:\n\n1⃣ 7.5M ADA for Community Builder Proposals — includes only those with ≥2.69B ADA support, excluding proposals from Intersect and founding entities.\n\n2⃣ 1.5M ADA for Amaru Rust Node Development — a PRAGMA-led initiative to diversify Cardano nodes and enhance network resilience.\n\n3⃣ 50M ADA for DeFi Liquidity — aims to seed liquidity into DEXs and stablecoins, with yield partially returned to the treasury.\n\nAs SIPO DRep, we’re evaluating these developments based on:\n\n🔍 Cautious governance: supports the 200M ADA NCL.\n🚀 Growth & momentum: supports maintaining the 350M ADA cap.\n⚖️ Balanced compromise: 300M ADA could be a pragmatic middle ground.\n\nFor funding proposals, our assessment will focus on:\nDoes it generate a return to the treasury?\nIs transparency and execution capacity ensured?\nDoes it set a strong precedent for the first year of decentralized financial governance?\n\nThe NCL is more than just a number — it reflects Cardano’s financial philosophy and growth trajectory.

          "text": "VOTE ❌: Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Budget - 275M ada Administered by Intersect \n\n===================\nPlease redelegate to another DRep, if you disagree with my NO vote. If you redelegate to a YES voting DRep, it will count as a YES. \n===================\n\nRATIONALE\nI am voting NO on the proposed 2025 Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Budget because I believe the total amount requested is too high, especially  for the first year of minimum viable on-chain governance. \n\nI also believe that bundling 39 proposals together into a single vote limits DReps’ ability to express the differentiated support that we saw in earlier stages. This approach flattens nuance and imposes an all-or-nothing decision on a diverse set of funding priorities.\n\nI also acknowledge the existence of the three founding entities that were allocated Genesis ADA that are working with different levels of success to improve Cardano according to their original missions. Some of these missions have been nominally completed, some of these missions continue in their original form, some continue in a new form. I do not pretend to know all the nuances. \n\nStill I take that as a factor in my decision-making. Treasury funds should be used judiciously in complement and in awareness of the existence of the entities. \n\nThis vote against this Budget in its full size is based on:\n\n1. My participation in the DRep voting stage and the level of DRep participation as a whole;\n2. The level of support that some proposals received relative to others;\n3. The relative importance of certain proposals vs others and the quality of the teams and their dedication to Cardano’s mission;\n4. And the expectation that Catalyst will likely gain sufficient support (in this or future budget proposals) to continue to support smaller, experimental, or commercial projects.\n\nWhile spending from the Treasury is not new (Catalyst has done it before), this is the first major annual on-chain budget, and it sets a precedent.\n\nIn my view, the issue is not inflation within the Cardano economy — most ADA will not be used to buy NFTs or FTs. Nor is it simply about a slightly higher disinflation rate. The deeper issue is ADA devaluation due to external sell pressure. Most of the funded ADA will be exchanged for fiat (USD, EUR, etc.), not recycled internally. This adds downward pressure on ADA’s price.\n\nIt is a see-saw that has its quirks. \n\nIn a real-world economy, if you spend more to \"jumpstart\" the economy, face inflation if the supply of services and goods cannot meet demand. \n\nIn a still nascent blockchain economy, spending more essentially means converting the native token for fiat, and the result is devaluation. We are not exchanging ADA directly for Cardano economy goods and services, we are selling it into the real world. The ADA is not recycled internally. This adds downward pressure on ADA’s price.\n\nThis devaluation affects everyone:\n\n1. The most important funded projects\n2. The projects that were not funded\n3. The builders who didn’t ask for funding \n4. The ADA holders who fund all of it through opportunity cost\n\nOf course, that is unavoidable. Most of the ADA allocated will likely be converted to fiat (USD, EUR, etc.) to pay for services, not retained or reused within the ecosystem. This creates exchange rate pressure, weakening ADA’s value.\n\nThe question isn’t whether devaluation will occur — it will. The real question is: Where do we draw the line? Do all 39 proposals in this budget bring more value than the cost of the devaluation they collectively impose? Do we need to bundle them all in one YES/NO budget vote? I think No. \n\nWe are approving a large, externally-focused budget at a time when Cardano’s “blockchain economy” and governance mechanism is still immature and internally fragile.\n\nTreasury funds should primarily be focused on critical public goods in different forms. Especially if they are open source; support infrastructure, research, tools, even education, promotion of Cardano. This applies when the goods align with the long-term mission of Cardano as public infrastructure. Yes, there may be exceptions that emerge, but those exceptions are expensive — and others will pay for them.\n\nIf we overfund less impactful proposals, we risk undermining the impact of the most critical ones, simply by diluting the value of what they are paid in.\n\nFor this reason, I believe a smaller, phased budget focused tightly on foundational public goods would be a better and safer starting point.\n\nI include this rationale as an earnest view of the proposed budget action with the aim of contributing to the process by encouraging the submitter (Intersect) to take more factors into account.",

          "Amount Concerns: Some stakeholders may find 300M ADA too high for fiscal discipline or too low for ambitious growth, reflecting ongoing debate on the ideal NCL figure. Concerns also exist that it might be illogical for those who previously supported smaller NCLs.",
          "NCL Definition & Process Issues: Persistent community concerns exist regarding the precise definition of NCL, its constitutional basis, approval thresholds, and the overall efficiency and clarity of the NCL-setting process.",
          "Risk of NCL Becoming a Spending Target: A general apprehension is that any NCL, regardless of its intended nature as a cap, might inadvertently become a spending goal.",
          "Timing and Scope Concerns: Introducing NCLs that extend into a subsequent year (e.g., 2026) is viewed by some as premature or an example of scope creep, preferring an initial focus on the immediate year.",
          "Preference for Alternative NCL Mechanisms: Some community members advocate for alternative NCL mechanisms, such as those based on a percentage of treasury revenue, for enhanced adaptability and sustainability over fixed ADA amounts.",

          "Provides Sufficient Buffer: Compared to a lower NCL (e.g., 200M), a 300M NCL offers a more adequate buffer for necessary spending and flexibility.",

          "Addresses Need for Longer-Term NCL: Setting an NCL for a period like Q3 2025 - Q2 2026 is better than separate, potentially misaligned, NCLs for 2025 and 2026, simplifying budget management for 12-month projects.",

        "summary": "The proposal intends to establish a 300M ADA Net Change Limit (NCL) for Cardano's treasury for the period spanning from epoch 563 to epoch 635 (roughly Q3 2025 to Q2 2026). This specific NCL aims to ensure financial continuity for treasury-funded projects, many of which have 12-month budget cycles and might face approval delays extending beyond June 2025. The proposed 300M ADA cap is stated to align closely with the anticipated treasury inflows during this timeframe. This action comes against a backdrop where Cardano is focused on significant technical evolution (like Leios and Hydra), scaling its ecosystem, and improving its competitive standing in areas like DeFi and developer adoption, while ensuring sustainable treasury management for long-term growth.",
        "myOpinion": "I support this proposal. The 300M ADA NCL for epochs 563-635 offers a pragmatic solution to ensure funding continuity for Cardano's development, crucial for its primary objective of technical evolution like Leios and Hydra. This 12-month outlook aligns with project needs and provides stability, which is vital for retaining talent and fostering long-term growth. While the 300M ADA figure is tied to projected inflows, which carry inherent uncertainty, it represents a more fiscally grounded approach than arbitrary limits. The consequences of not having a clear, extended NCL could involve disruptive, piecemeal funding debates, hindering progress on strategic initiatives and impacting Cardano's competitiveness. While the NCL is a cap and not a spending directive, rigorous scrutiny of individual budget proposals remains essential. This proposal, by facilitating stable resource allocation, supports Cardano's aim to be a leading blockchain platform by enabling investment in good engineering. Future governance iterations should continue to refine the NCL setting process itself for greater efficiency and consensus."

Constitutionality of Threshold\nThe proposal specifies a 67% threshold of the active voting stake to pass. \nThis raises a question of the constitution's guardrail TREASURY-01a intent for it leaves unclear whether the \"threshold\" value of 50% is an intrinsic part of the \nguardrail’s identity or merely part of a mechanism to establish if the NCL proposal is agreed. \n\nSpecifically, does 'TREASURY-01a' mean an NCL requires approval by more than 50% of the active voting stake, with the threshold as a core part of the guardrail? Or does it imply the NCL must exceed a standalone threshold of at least 50%, with the proposal’s support measured against it in a separate step to confirm agreement?\"\n\nIf the constitution's 50% threshold is intrinsic to the guardrail, attempting to change the threshold to 67% could be deemed unconstitutional. \nHowever, if the guardrail is a standalone benchmark and its conditions are met the proposal is constitutional and the approval process continues.\nIf the proposal does not garner approval exceeding the proposer's threshold of 67% the proposal cannot be agreed.\nI believe allowing a threshold above 50% enhances governance rigor and support proposers setting it, as they can set the voting period. However, enabling this functionality would require amending the constitution, updating ledger rules, and revising voting tools. Thus, I accept that the vote must exceed only 50% to agree an NCL.\n\n4. Immutability of Supporting Documents\nThe ability to edit supporting documents after approval poses a significant risk, potentially undermining the proposal’s integrity. This issue requires attention from \nthe Constitutional Committee to enforce immutability and maintain trust in the process.\n\n5. Multi-Year Scope Concern\nGiven the current maturity of Cardano’s governance, a single-year budget scope might be more appropriate, with a new NCL proposal potentially superseding this proposal before 2026. However, the delay in finalizing the 2025 budget makes the inclusion of 250 million ada as next year's NCL advantageous. It encourages discussions for the2026 budget process earlier. I would expect a new 2026 NCL limit proposal to supercede this info action but not before the end of 2025. \n\n6. Budget Period and Timeline Misalignment\nWith the 2025 first quarter past, the NCL’s full-year value of 300 million ADA raises concerns about potential back payments for prior work, which I oppose unless explicitly specified. \nThe NCL should proportionally reflect the remaining timeline being funded to ensure accuracy in resource allocation.\n\n7. Urgent Need for a 2025 Budget\nA budget ceiling is urgently needed to cap treasury withdrawals for the 2025 roadmap and budget, including work on Ouroboros Leios and ZK technologies. This limit must balance treasury stability with the demand for improved performance to keep Cardano competitive. While the proposed 300 million ada maximum is high, it’s acceptable given current budget discussions.\n\n8. NCL Value Alignment and Budget Prudence\nThe NCL values (300 million ada for 2025 and 250 million for 2026) align reasonably with projected treasury inflows over the two-year period. I prefer budgets that maintain a surplus, especially given the current volatile cryptocurrency climate. A lower NCL for 2025, around 200 million ada, would reflect the nascent state of the budget process, reinforce prudent monetary policy and mitigate the negative effect on ada price by treasury withdrawls. \nHowever, the pressing need for a budget decision supersedes my preference for a reduced value.\n\n9. Percentage based limits\nAdopting percentage-based limits based on treasury inflows could enhance predictability and serve as guardrails to streamline future budget processes.\n\n10. Conclusion\nDespite irregularities in constitutional requirements, and other concerns, the urgent need for a 2025 budget justifies overlooking these issues. While I’d favor a lower NCL value out of fiscal caution, the priority of passing a budget compels me to vote YES. The Constitutional Committee can address the issues raised here to refine governance practices.",

          "text": "I voted NO ⛔️to reduce the Net Change Limit (NCL) to 200M ADA, which has been one of the toughest governance decisions so far. \n\nIt feels like there’s no entirely good option here.\n\nMoreover, I myself called for a lower NCL.\n\nThe current NCL of 350M ADA has some notable drawbacks.\n\nIf high selling pressure causes ADA’s price to drop significantly, say to 0.2 USD, it could result in serious challenges. \n\nFunding the ecosystem in dollar terms would require selling a large amount of ADA from the treasury, leading to a spiral of selling pressure that could worsen the situation.\n\nCardano Whale (@cardano_whale) pointed out that some projects like Tezos and Polkadot have invested heavily in their ecosystems, possess innovative technologies, yet struggle to gain substantial attention.\n\nI fully agree with that.\n\nFor blockchains, maintaining a presence in the top 10 market capitalization rankings is vital.\n\nRetail investors, institutions, and crypto enthusiasts evaluate projects not only based on technology but also on market performance. \n\nIf Cardano drops out of the top 10 for an extended period, it may never regain its position, regardless of decentralization or technological progress like Ouroboros Leios. \n\nThis is an important factor to consider, even if it feels unfair or subjective.\n\nOn the other hand, reducing the NCL to 200M ADA comes with its own set of concerns.\n\nCardano needs investments to advance its technology, support builders, and develop the ecosystem. Without increased user activity, Treasury revenue won't grow. \n\nSpending on maintenance and development in the next years risks exhausting the reserve, ultimately making Cardano economically unsustainable.\n\nProtocol security also hinges on attractive staking rewards and incentives. Moreover, Ouroboros Leios’s potential will remain untapped without active developers, tools, and a growing DeFi ecosystem. Investments in all these areas are crucial.\n\nIOG has made their funding requirements clear: Core Dev needs 96M ADA, Catalyst 69M ADA, and Research 27M ADA. Combined, this totals 192M ADA. The offer from IOG is simple: either approve this funding or let it be.\n\nDebates around fairness, IOG and Charles’s past contributions, and the definition of “completion” for Cardano have their place, but the reality is that IOG holds unmatched expertise in the protocol. No other entity can effectively take over maintenance, development, and research at the same pace or quality.\n\nIf DReps allocate 192M ADA to IOG, only 8M ADA remains for other projects.\n\nAfter reviewing budget proposals, I supported only the essentials I believe the ecosystem absolutely needs: projects like Midgard, Starstream, Hydra, ZK Rollups, Blockfrost, Lucid, Chainlink integration, and others. \n\nFor the CORE category alone, this amounts to around 12M ADA. Across all categories, my total approved budget comes to 213M ADA.\n\nGiven my own estimate of required expenditures is 213M ADA, I cannot support an NCL of 200M ADA. \n\nIt would contradict my stance on necessary project funding versus the cap I approve. This inconsistency guided my decision to vote NO on reducing the NCL.\n\nCardano requires effective marketing and improved governance support, as the current situation is far from ideal.\n\nInvesting in the ecosystem and advancing new technologies must go hand in hand to ensure sustainable growth.\n\nApproving the NCL of 200M ADA, in my view, would mean preserving the status quo, leaving all key responsibilities to IOG while neglecting investment in the broader ecosystem. \n\nEssentially, it would restrict funding for entities that are vital to the ecosystem, just as IOG is.\n\nAn important consideration is the expected scenarios surrounding the NCL.\n\nBoth NCLs, an NCL of 350M ADA and 200M ADA, are extremes in my view.\n\nThe current NCL, set at 350M ADA, has strong support with 76% of the voting stake participating. Nearly the entire voting stake approved it. Drastically reducing the NCL from 350M to 200M ADA would be either irresponsible or overly ambitious.\n\nWhat would happen next? Builders, Intersect, IOG, or others would likely submit a new governance action proposing an intermediate NCL, perhaps 250M or 300M ADA. Alternatively, multiple proposals could be submitted simultaneously.\n\nThis scenario would create an unstable environment that is counterproductive and difficult to support. Such instability undermines progress.\n\nMoreover, the crypto community has little interest in prolonged debates about how much the Cardano ecosystem can afford to invest.\n\nIn an unstable environment, even proposing a coherent budget becomes nearly impossible.\n\nCurrently, we have an NCL of 350M ADA. Consider this likely scenario:\n\nIntersect is expected to submit a governance action for the budget expiring in June. Meanwhile, if a new NCL of 200M ADA is approved by the end of May, the proposed budget would effectively become unconstitutional unless it is approved before the new NCL takes effect. \n\nThis complicates the process and further highlights the issues with sudden, extreme changes.\n\nDebating the NCL through governance actions is both inefficient and overly time-consuming.\n\nIt seems likely that the community's consensus would fall somewhere between 250M–300M ADA. However, no off-chain temperature check was conducted (to which the majority of the community would respond) before the on-chain vote, which led to the current NCL being approved simply to allow the budgeting process to continue.\n\nThe concept of the NCL itself is starting to feel unnecessary, as it constantly shifts based on the majority vote. If the voting stake agrees to increase or decrease the NCL, it will inevitably happen.\n\nIt’s important to emphasize that the NCL doesn’t dictate the amount that must be spent from the treasury. Every withdrawal proposal still requires approval from the community.\n\nI would likely vote YES if the current proposal fell within the 250M–300M ADA range. If a proposal like this is submitted, I would support it, as it aligns with the budget I consider reasonable based on the proposals I have endorsed.\n\nHowever, my decision isn’t final and may change depending on future developments in governance. \n\nFor instance, if governance actions combine multiple proposals that result in an excessively high total cost, or if the IOG proposal is grouped with several proposals I don’t support, or one I strongly oppose, such as the Daedalus 2025 Service Enhancement, I might reconsider my stance.\n\nIf the only way to prevent a poor budget outcome is to vote for a lower NCL, I am prepared to do so. This decision is nuanced and cannot be seen in black-and-white terms.\n\nI want to avoid a scenario where approving a lower NCL inevitably results in another GA submission. Addressing the NCL repeatedly is time-consuming and unproductive. \n\nDReps need to prioritize budget proposals instead.\n\nA higher NCL serves no purpose if it ends up funding low-quality projects within the budget.\n\nMy DRep ID:\ndrep1km69g7ksf8t5g0h9d9tkrcd2tezxelx0wtr76rv2mrkl5nzd6v3",

          "text": "VOTE ❌: Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Budget - 275M ada Administered by Intersect \n\n===================\nPlease redelegate to another DRep, if you disagree with my NO vote. If you redelegate to a YES voting DRep, it will count as a YES. \n===================\n\nRATIONALE\nI am voting NO on the proposed 2025 Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Budget because I believe the total amount requested is too high, especially  for the first year of minimum viable on-chain governance. \n\nI also believe that bundling 39 proposals together into a single vote limits DReps’ ability to express the differentiated support that we saw in earlier stages. This approach flattens nuance and imposes an all-or-nothing decision on a diverse set of funding priorities.\n\nI also acknowledge the existence of the three founding entities that were allocated Genesis ADA that are working with different levels of success to improve Cardano according to their original missions. Some of these missions have been nominally completed, some of these missions continue in their original form, some continue in a new form. I do not pretend to know all the nuances. \n\nStill I take that as a factor in my decision-making. Treasury funds should be used judiciously in complement and in awareness of the existence of the entities. \n\nThis vote against this Budget in its full size is based on:\n\n1. My participation in the DRep voting stage and the level of DRep participation as a whole;\n2. The level of support that some proposals received relative to others;\n3. The relative importance of certain proposals vs others and the quality of the teams and their dedication to Cardano’s mission;\n4. And the expectation that Catalyst will likely gain sufficient support (in this or future budget proposals) to continue to support smaller, experimental, or commercial projects.\n\nWhile spending from the Treasury is not new (Catalyst has done it before), this is the first major annual on-chain budget, and it sets a precedent.\n\nIn my view, the issue is not inflation within the Cardano economy — most ADA will not be used to buy NFTs or FTs. Nor is it simply about a slightly higher disinflation rate. The deeper issue is ADA devaluation due to external sell pressure. Most of the funded ADA will be exchanged for fiat (USD, EUR, etc.), not recycled internally. This adds downward pressure on ADA’s price.\n\nIt is a see-saw that has its quirks. \n\nIn a real-world economy, if you spend more to \"jumpstart\" the economy, face inflation if the supply of services and goods cannot meet demand. \n\nIn a still nascent blockchain economy, spending more essentially means converting the native token for fiat, and the result is devaluation. We are not exchanging ADA directly for Cardano economy goods and services, we are selling it into the real world. The ADA is not recycled internally. This adds downward pressure on ADA’s price.\n\nThis devaluation affects everyone:\n\n1. The most important funded projects\n2. The projects that were not funded\n3. The builders who didn’t ask for funding \n4. The ADA holders who fund all of it through opportunity cost\n\nOf course, that is unavoidable. Most of the ADA allocated will likely be converted to fiat (USD, EUR, etc.) to pay for services, not retained or reused within the ecosystem.

          "originalText": "VOTE ❌: Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Budget - 275M ada Administered by Intersect \n\n===================\nPlease redelegate to another DRep, if you disagree with my NO vote. If you redelegate to a YES voting DRep, it will count as a YES. \n===================\n\nRATIONALE\nI am voting NO on the proposed 2025 Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Budget because I believe the total amount requested is too high, especially  for the first year of minimum viable on-chain governance. \n\nI also believe that bundling 39 proposals together into a single vote limits DReps’ ability to express the differentiated support that we saw in earlier stages. This approach flattens nuance and imposes an all-or-nothing decision on a diverse set of funding priorities.\n\nI also acknowledge the existence of the three founding entities that were allocated Genesis ADA that are working with different levels of success to improve Cardano according to their original missions. Some of these missions have been nominally completed, some of these missions continue in their original form, some continue in a new form. I do not pretend to know all the nuances. \n\nStill I take that as a factor in my decision-making. Treasury funds should be used judiciously in complement and in awareness of the existence of the entities. \n\nThis vote against this Budget in its full size is based on:\n\n1. My participation in the DRep voting stage and the level of DRep participation as a whole;\n2. The level of support that some proposals received relative to others;\n3. The relative importance of certain proposals vs others and the quality of the teams and their dedication to Cardano’s mission;\n4. And the expectation that Catalyst will likely gain sufficient support (in this or future budget proposals) to continue to support smaller, experimental, or commercial projects.\n\nWhile spending from the Treasury is not new (Catalyst has done it before), this is the first major annual on-chain budget, and it sets a precedent.\n\nIn my view, the issue is not inflation within the Cardano economy — most ADA will not be used to buy NFTs or FTs. Nor is it simply about a slightly higher disinflation rate. The deeper issue is ADA devaluation due to external sell pressure. Most of the funded ADA will be exchanged for fiat (USD, EUR, etc.), not recycled internally. This adds downward pressure on ADA’s price.\n\nIt is a see-saw that has its quirks. \n\nIn a real-world economy, if you spend more to \"jumpstart\" the economy, face inflation if the supply of services and goods cannot meet demand. \n\nIn a still nascent blockchain economy, spending more essentially means converting the native token for fiat, and the result is devaluation. We are not exchanging ADA directly for Cardano economy goods and services, we are selling it into the real world. The ADA is not recycled internally. This adds downward pressure on ADA’s price.\n\nThis devaluation affects everyone:\n\n1. The most important funded projects\n2. The projects that were not funded\n3. The builders who didn’t ask for funding \n4. The ADA holders who fund all of it through opportunity cost\n\nOf course, that is unavoidable. Most of the ADA allocated will likely be converted to fiat (USD, EUR, etc.) to pay for services, not retained or reused within the ecosystem. This creates exchange rate pressure, weakening ADA’s value.\n\nThe question isn’t whether devaluation will occur — it will. The real question is: Where do we draw the line? Do all 39 proposals in this budget bring more value than the cost of the devaluation they collectively impose? Do we need to bundle them all in one YES/NO budget vote? I think No. \n\nWe are approving a large, externally-focused budget at a time when Cardano’s “blockchain economy” and governance mechanism is still immature and internally fragile.\n\nTreasury funds should primarily be focused on critical public goods in different forms. Especially if they are open source; support infrastructure, research, tools, even education, promotion of Cardano. This applies when the goods align with the long-term mission of Cardano as public infrastructure. Yes, there may be exceptions that emerge, but those exceptions are expensive — and others will pay for them.\n\nIf we overfund less impactful proposals, we risk undermining the impact of the most critical ones, simply by diluting the value of what they are paid in.\n\nFor this reason, I believe a smaller, phased budget focused tightly on foundational public goods would be a better and safer starting point.\n\nI include this rationale as an earnest view of the proposed budget action with the aim of contributing to the process by encouraging the submitter (Intersect) to take more factors into account."

          "rationale": "## Executive summary\n\n> **NOTE**\n>\n> All the scopes described are estimated in FTE (Full Time Employee) valued at $200k per annum.\n\n[Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) is an ongoing project that is already a few months old, and resources have initially been allocated to bootstrap its development. Given the core nature of [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) and in order to avoid becoming financially dependent on a single entity for its development, we are seeking **₳1.5M** of additional funding for the **second half of 2025**.\n\nThe table below breaks down the current/estimated effort, the fraction of resources already secured from other sources of funding, and the resources needed. It covers the whole of 2025.\n\n| Scope                                            | Owner    | Estimated effort | Resources already secured | Resources needed |\n| ---                                              | ---      | ---              | ---                       | ---              |\n| Ledger                                           | Matthias | 2.5 FTEs         | 1 FTE                     | 1.5 FTEs         |\n| Consensus and simulation                         | Arnaud   | 2.5 FTEs         | 1 FTE                     | 1.5 FTEs         |\n| Networking                                       | Santiago | 1 FTE            | 1 FTE                     | 0 FTEs           |\n| Ad-hoc Mercenaries                               | Pi       | 2.5 FTEs         | 0 FTEs                    | 2.5 FTEs         |\n| Project Management, Public Relations & Marketing | Damien   | 0.5 FTEs         | 0 FTEs                    | 0.5 FTEs         |\n\nThe total resources without funding for 2025 adds up to **6 FTEs**. Considering this budget ask is only for **the second half of 2025**, it halves to `$600,000` (600K) once converted to USD (`$`). We then add a 25% contingency budget to cope with our optimistic bias: we are aware that our forecast is subject to underestimating complexity, overlooking challenges, and undervaluing the time and cost required to deliver.\n\nWith this contingency, we end up at **`$750,000` (750K)**. Finally, using a conservative conversion rate of 0.5 ADA (`₳`) per USD (`$`) at the date of the withdrawal, we formulate a budget of **`₳1,500,000` (1.5M)**.\n\n> **NOTE**\n>\n> The Networking scope described in our [design documentation](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru/blob/main/engineering-decision-records/006-design-phase-documentation.md) is included in our proposal for reference but is already covered by a [Catalyst proposal](https://projectcatalyst.io/funds/12/cardano-open-developers/amaru-p2p-networking-component-by-txpipe). It is fully managed by Santiago.\n\n## Administration of the budget\n\nThe [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) maintainer committee will ensure **direct administration** of the budget, assisted with **an on-chain smart contract** (developed in open source, still incomplete, but aimed to be done and fully audited by the time of the first withdrawal).\n\nThe fund management, responsibilities and remuneration of contributors will follow PRAGMA's legal framework provided in annex under [PRAGMA Maintainer Committee Framework](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafkreiabxyva5lfm6zztg7tnktxvvbbucljrce7hlrp4p6hropqzfaip3y).\n\nIn addition, the smart contract's role is to ensure that the expenditure of funds is done in accordance with the scope defined in this budget and authorized by the relevant scope owners.\n\nWe recognize the following capabilities of this contract:\n\n1. **Standard withdrawal**: A scope owner asks other scope owners for money to be withdrawn from his scope.\n2. **Contingency withdrawal**: A scope owner asks other scope owners to withdraw an amount from the contingency funds.\n3. **Scope reconciliation**: A scope owner asks other scope owners for a change of ownership (or a reallocation of budget).\n4. **Contingency refund/closing**: scope owners ask to send the leftovers from the contingency budget to be sent back to the Cardano treasury.\n5. **Credential rotation**: In case of lost credentials or the departure of a scope owner, a mechanism allows the rotation of credentials to a new scope owner upon approval by all (5 out of 5) PRAGMA members (effectively capturing PRAGMA's board decision to appoint new maintainers).\n6. **Failsafe**: In the extreme scenario where credentials would be irremediably lost, thus preventing any further decision, a failsafe mechanism allows all unconsumed funds to be sent back to the Cardano treasury.\n\n## Reporting\n\n#### Quarterly reports\n\nFollowing [PRAGMA's Decision Record 006](https://github.com/pragma-org/PDRs/tree/main/PDR-0006-Project-Reporting), progress on [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) shall be **at least reported quarterly**. The content of [these reports](https://pragma.io/projects/amaru#quarterly-reports) is straightforward and includes the following:\n\n- Problems that require board attention (infrastructure, trademarks, etc.)\n- Project status (active, inactive, initiating, etc.)\n- A changelog (last committer addition)\n- Next planned steps (new releases, significant changes, etc.)\n- Reflection & Performances\n\nThis recurrent interaction will provide an overview of the project with a long-term perspective and support the maintainers' committee in aligning priorities and identifying the next steps. The outcome of these reviews will be publicly available as documentation in [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru)'s GitHub repository.\n\n#### Regular demos\n\nAmaru is demo-driven. We strive to integrate early and provide runnable examples showcasing the latest features as the project is being developed. The cadence for these demos is around 4 to 6 weeks, as illustrated on the [existing track record](https://pragma.io/projects/amaru#demos).\n\nWe will naturally continue to **record and post demos regularly**.\n\n## Constitutionality checklist\n\nBeing one of the first proposals of this nature ever submitted, it is easy to get things wrong. In an effort to convince ourselves of its constitutionality, we thought relevant to include a checklist of the points we cover and for each, our interpretation of the Cardano Constitution.\n\n#### Purpose\n\n- [x] This proposal is for work intended to enhance the security, decentralization and long-term sustainability of Cardano.\n\n#### Article III.5: the process of on-chain governance\n\n- [x] We have submitted this proposal in a standardized, legible format, which includes a URL and hash of all documented off-chain content. We believe our rationale to be detailed and sufficient. The proposal contains a title, abstract, reason for the proposal and relevant supporting materials.\n\n#### Article IV.1: proposing budgets\n\n- [x] This proposal accords with the provisions of this article as it is intended to cover the maintenance and future development of the Cardano Blockchain.\n\n- [x] This proposal covers a shorter period than 73 epochs, which is permitted in this section of the Constitution, to match the Net-Change Limit period.\n\n#### Article IV.2: funds administration\n\n- [x] This proposal specifies an administrator in accordance with this provision. It also specifies an internal administration process using smart contracts and an off-chain overseeing committee, meeting the requirements of this clause, which requires a process that may include an administrator.\n\n#### Article IV.3: Net-Change Limit\n\n- [x] Being of ₳1.5M and covering the second half of 2025, this proposal and the treasury withdrawals it would enable do not violate the currently agreed upon Net-Change Limit.\n\n#### Article IV.4: Auditor\n\n- [x] This proposal makes provisions for an auditor (covered by the _Ad-hoc mercenaries_ scope).\n\n#### Guardrails\n\n- [x] This proposal is subject to _TREASURY-04a_ in that it defines a Cardano blockchain ecosystem budget. It requires a threshold greater than 50% of the DReps' active voting stake to be considered approved and enable subsequent withdrawals pertaining to this budget.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) project represents a major step towards node diversity through the development of a modular, high-performance, and interoperable block-producing node for Cardano. Our approach, rooted in openness, innovation, and operational resilience, aims to deliver significant advancements in blockchain technology without compromising on security.\n\nIn addition to this budget, we provide a detailed document outlining:\n\n- explicit assumptions about the project, the valuation and the scopes covered;\n- comparisons to similar projects of developing blockchain nodes; and\n- the methodology used for managing the project, its deliveries, its finance and its governance.\n\nThrough rigorous design and execution phases, we have outlined actionable scopes, realistic timelines, and comprehensive resource allocations. The detailed breakdown of scopes, funding and resources already secured reflects our commitment to transparency and efficiency. While we remain optimistic about our forecasts, we acknowledge the complexities involved and have incorporated contingencies to address unforeseen challenges.\n\nMore than a mere budget, this proposal is an invitation to collaborate and innovate together. The [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) project is ambitious yet achievable through the collective effort of our contributors and the broader Cardano community. By focusing on building, learning, and demonstrating tangible progress, [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) paves the way for a more resilient and decentralized Cardano ecosystem, ensuring long-term reliability and innovation.\n\nLet's build the future of Cardano together.",

The current maintainer committee comprises of:\n\n- [Arnaud Bailly](https://github.com/abailly) responsible for the consensus and simulation testing.\n- [Matthias Benkort](https://github.com/ktorz) responsible for the ledger & overall architecture.\n- [Pi Lanningham](https://github.com/Quantumplation) responsible for the ad hoc work and middleware integrations.\n- [Santiago Carmuega](https://github.com/scarmuega) responsible for the p2p networking.\n- [Damien Czapla](https://github.com/Dam-CZ) responsible for the project management, public relations & marketing.\n\nEach member of the maintainer committee is in charge of a scope and has oversight on its delivery, which includes managing an associated budget.\n\n## Why build another node\n\nOne of Cardano's key assets is its legendary robustness and stability, which is mainly attributed to the existing Haskell node, which has been working without significant disruption for about five years now (counting since the Byron reboot, circa February 2020).\n\nSo why bother with another node? The answer is, of course, plural:\n\n#### 1. **Better resource usage**\n\nSoftware is ultimately a collection of design decisions and trade-offs. Some of those trade-offs in the Haskell node have led to rather high resource usages (e.g., resident memory), thus leading to the creation of specific protocol parameters (e.g., min-utxo-value) as countermeasures to ensure resource usage remains somewhat bounded. Our analysis is that different (albeit acceptable) trade-offs would yield better resource usage.\n\n#### 2. **Industry-grade observability**\n\nObservability is challenging, and it is even more so when rolling your own solution. With [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru), we intend to embrace industry standards for monitoring, tracing, and logging to drastically enhance the user experience for operators seeking insights into their node's behaviour.\n\n#### 3. **Enhanced interoperability**\n\n[Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) being primarily written in Rust means that we can more easily leverage an existing and thriving ecosystem of blockchain solutions and aim at multiple target platforms (e.g. web-assembly, RISC-V). This opens up not only to a wide variety of potential contributors but also to many new use cases that are much harder (not to say unrealistic) to achieve with a Haskell node.\n\n#### 4. **Higher-assurance & robustness**\n\nDeveloping a new implementation of existing software means dissecting every part of the original implementation. Along the way, bugs and discrepancies with the specification are commonly found through conformance testing. Gaps in the documentation can also be identified and addressed. The development of [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) has already proven this on several occasions. In the long run, more node implementations can be a synonym for reduced development time by allowing all implementations to converge faster towards better designs and more robust implementations.\n\n#### 5. **Decentralization**\n\nIn a world where Byzantine fault tolerance is at the centre and where decentralization is a paramount value, we believe that a single-node implementation presents a single point of failure and a central point of control. A new node not only increases the overall resilience of the network but also provides perspectives in terms of a roadmap and use cases.\n\n---\n\nWith [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru), we believe that we can reconcile these goals while preserving Cardano's focus on security and robustness. Like Haskell, Rust is a statically typed language that provides strong compile-time guarantees and fine-grained memory management. Its ecosystem is also well-equipped for high assurance, making it a sane choice for implementing blockchain solutions.",

        "rationale": "## Executive summary\n\n> **NOTE**\n>\n> All the scopes described are estimated in FTE (Full Time Employee) valued at $200k per annum.\n\n[Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) is an ongoing project that is already a few months old, and resources have initially been allocated to bootstrap its development. Given the core nature of [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) and in order to avoid becoming financially dependent on a single entity for its development, we are seeking **₳1.5M** of additional funding for the **second half of 2025**.\n\nThe table below breaks down the current/estimated effort, the fraction of resources already secured from other sources of funding, and the resources needed. It covers the whole of 2025.\n\n| Scope                                            | Owner    | Estimated effort | Resources already secured | Resources needed |\n| ---                                              | ---      | ---              | ---                       | ---              |\n| Ledger                                           | Matthias | 2.5 FTEs         | 1 FTE                     | 1.5 FTEs         |\n| Consensus and simulation                         | Arnaud   | 2.5 FTEs         | 1 FTE                     | 1.5 FTEs         |\n| Networking                                       | Santiago | 1 FTE            | 1 FTE                     | 0 FTEs           |\n| Ad-hoc Mercenaries                               | Pi       | 2.5 FTEs         | 0 FTEs                    | 2.5 FTEs         |\n| Project Management, Public Relations & Marketing | Damien   | 0.5 FTEs         | 0 FTEs                    | 0.5 FTEs         |\n\nThe total resources without funding for 2025 adds up to **6 FTEs**. Considering this budget ask is only for **the second half of 2025**, it halves to `$600,000` (600K) once converted to USD (`$`). We then add a 25% contingency budget to cope with our optimistic bias: we are aware that our forecast is subject to underestimating complexity, overlooking challenges, and undervaluing the time and cost required to deliver.\n\nWith this contingency, we end up at **`$750,000` (750K)**. Finally, using a conservative conversion rate of 0.5 ADA (`₳`) per USD (`$`) at the date of the withdrawal, we formulate a budget of **`₳1,500,000` (1.5M)**.\n\n> **NOTE**\n>\n> The Networking scope described in our [design documentation](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru/blob/main/engineering-decision-records/006-design-phase-documentation.md) is included in our proposal for reference but is already covered by a [Catalyst proposal](https://projectcatalyst.io/funds/12/cardano-open-developers/amaru-p2p-networking-component-by-txpipe). It is fully managed by Santiago.\n\n## Administration of the budget\n\nThe [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) maintainer committee will ensure **direct administration** of the budget, assisted with **an on-chain smart contract** (developed in open source, still incomplete, but aimed to be done and fully audited by the time of the first withdrawal).\n\nThe fund management, responsibilities and remuneration of contributors will follow PRAGMA's legal framework provided in annex under [PRAGMA Maintainer Committee Framework](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafkreiabxyva5lfm6zztg7tnktxvvbbucljrce7hlrp4p6hropqzfaip3y).\n\nIn addition, the smart contract's role is to ensure that the expenditure of funds is done in accordance with the scope defined in this budget and authorized by the relevant scope owners.\n\nWe recognize the following capabilities of this contract:\n\n1. **Standard withdrawal**: A scope owner asks other scope owners for money to be withdrawn from his scope.\n2. **Contingency withdrawal**: A scope owner asks other scope owners to withdraw an amount from the contingency funds.\n3. **Scope reconciliation**: A scope owner asks other scope owners for a change of ownership (or a reallocation of budget).\n4. **Contingency refund/closing**: scope owners ask to send the leftovers from the contingency budget to be sent back to the Cardano treasury.\n5. **Credential rotation**: In case of lost credentials or the departure of a scope owner, a mechanism allows the rotation of credentials to a new scope owner upon approval by all (5 out of 5) PRAGMA members (effectively capturing PRAGMA's board decision to appoint new maintainers).\n6. **Failsafe**: In the extreme scenario where credentials would be irremediably lost, thus preventing any further decision, a failsafe mechanism allows all unconsumed funds to be sent back to the Cardano treasury.\n\n## Reporting\n\n#### Quarterly reports\n\nFollowing [PRAGMA's Decision Record 006](https://github.com/pragma-org/PDRs/tree/main/PDR-0006-Project-Reporting), progress on [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) shall be **at least reported quarterly**. The content of [these reports](https://pragma.io/projects/amaru#quarterly-reports) is straightforward and includes the following:\n\n- Problems that require board attention (infrastructure, trademarks, etc.)\n- Project status (active, inactive, initiating, etc.)\n- A changelog (last committer addition)\n- Next planned steps (new releases, significant changes, etc.)\n- Reflection & Performances\n\nThis recurrent interaction will provide an overview of the project with a long-term perspective and support the maintainers' committee in aligning priorities and identifying the next steps. The outcome of these reviews will be publicly available as documentation in [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru)'s GitHub repository.\n\n#### Regular demos\n\nAmaru is demo-driven. We strive to integrate early and provide runnable examples showcasing the latest features as the project is being developed. The cadence for these demos is around 4 to 6 weeks, as illustrated on the [existing track record](https://pragma.io/projects/amaru#demos).\n\nWe will naturally continue to **record and post demos regularly**.\n\n## Constitutionality checklist\n\nBeing one of the first proposals of this nature ever submitted, it is easy to get things wrong. In an effort to convince ourselves of its constitutionality, we thought relevant to include a checklist of the points we cover and for each, our interpretation of the Cardano Constitution.\n\n#### Purpose\n\n- [x] This proposal is for work intended to enhance the security, decentralization and long-term sustainability of Cardano.\n\n#### Article III.5: the process of on-chain governance\n\n- [x] We have submitted this proposal in a standardized, legible format, which includes a URL and hash of all documented off-chain content. We believe our rationale to be detailed and sufficient. The proposal contains a title, abstract, reason for the proposal and relevant supporting materials.\n\n#### Article IV.1: proposing budgets\n\n- [x] This proposal accords with the provisions of this article as it is intended to cover the maintenance and future development of the Cardano Blockchain.\n\n- [x] This proposal covers a shorter period than 73 epochs, which is permitted in this section of the Constitution, to match the Net-Change Limit period.\n\n#### Article IV.2: funds administration\n\n- [x] This proposal specifies an administrator in accordance with this provision. It also specifies an internal administration process using smart contracts and an off-chain overseeing committee, meeting the requirements of this clause, which requires a process that may include an administrator.\n\n#### Article IV.3: Net-Change Limit\n\n- [x] Being of ₳1.5M and covering the second half of 2025, this proposal and the treasury withdrawals it would enable do not violate the currently agreed upon Net-Change Limit.\n\n#### Article IV.4: Auditor\n\n- [x] This proposal makes provisions for an auditor (covered by the _Ad-hoc mercenaries_ scope).\n\n#### Guardrails\n\n- [x] This proposal is subject to _TREASURY-04a_ in that it defines a Cardano blockchain ecosystem budget. It requires a threshold greater than 50% of the DReps' active voting stake to be considered approved and enable subsequent withdrawals pertaining to this budget.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) project represents a major step towards node diversity through the development of a modular, high-performance, and interoperable block-producing node for Cardano. Our approach, rooted in openness, innovation, and operational resilience, aims to deliver significant advancements in blockchain technology without compromising on security.\n\nIn addition to this budget, we provide a detailed document outlining:\n\n- explicit assumptions about the project, the valuation and the scopes covered;\n- comparisons to similar projects of developing blockchain nodes; and\n- the methodology used for managing the project, its deliveries, its finance and its governance.\n\nThrough rigorous design and execution phases, we have outlined actionable scopes, realistic timelines, and comprehensive resource allocations. The detailed breakdown of scopes, funding and resources already secured reflects our commitment to transparency and efficiency. While we remain optimistic about our forecasts, we acknowledge the complexities involved and have incorporated contingencies to address unforeseen challenges.\n\nMore than a mere budget, this proposal is an invitation to collaborate and innovate together. The [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) project is ambitious yet achievable through the collective effort of our contributors and the broader Cardano community. By focusing on building, learning, and demonstrating tangible progress, [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) paves the way for a more resilient and decentralized Cardano ecosystem, ensuring long-term reliability and innovation.\n\nLet's build the future of Cardano together.",

Of course it cannot succed if they get 1 mln ADA but they cannot get 500 mln ADA either, as this almost 1/3 of the current trasury? \n\nBudget discussions will be hard, as always since some money is also operational for an organisation, hard to justify every cent. \n\nCardano Community must stay extremely vigilant here but over vigilance is also not good, e.g. we won't PERAS or LEIOS or other things.\n\nWe do not want to be held hostage either since obviously domain knowledge is there and this is one of the reason why Amaru by @pragma_org is so critical so that Cardano Community is not hostage to one company with extreme talent and development skills and potentially dictates out of the blue prices.\n\n#Cardano"

My reasons for this are well documented, but primarily relate to the emissions-price pressure-value add relationships.\n\nCore dev\nA reasonable proposal by IOG to keep delivering on critical roadmap items would get my instant support. In my view the one we have seen on gov tools ticks that box, if with a slightly hefty ask. Also assuming no surprises, I’d approve associated forks and changes. \n\nI am aware others besides IOG could do some of the work, but I think a safe approach in the first years of governance would be to only gradually diversify the work beyond IOG, rather than pull away from them immediately. Again, being conservative.\n\nHigh impact cost efficient proposals\nCost efficient, high impact technology efforts by other, ideally proven, actors. Think Midgard, Starstream or alternative nodes for single digit millions of ADA. Willing to entertain all similar impact and cost efficient ones.\n\nOrgs\nAssorted spending for Intersect and similar orgs pushing Cardano forward, if the asks are reasonable and well documented / detailed. Smaller asks will naturally be an easier yes.\n\nCatalyst and/or Intersect budget\nA slimmed down version of Catalyst to capture a lot of the efforts others want to put forward. Catalyst is a system that is not perfect, but is improving (eg quadratic voting) and is the current best framework we have for such things. Intersect might complement this, but needs to prove itself.\n\nSummary\nThis covers core tech, non core tech innovation, orgs and all the other proposals via Intersect/Catalyst.\n\nI think at a high level it should in principle be possible to fit all the above into a NCL of 150m ADA, though that would require some frugality on the part of all participants.\n\nMy stance on governance is that it should be transparent and on-chain wherever possible. I am currently unsure whether the Intersect budget process is as robust as what we have in place with Catalyst, and in any case it would need to prove itself.\n\nTherefore my preference would be to pull some of the tech related ones that I mentioned out of this process, and put them to a direct DRep vote fairly soon. Shrink down both Catalyst/Intersect budgets significantly and put them to a vote. I’ll likely support them."

          "originalText": "@JaromirTesar \n\nScalability and Funding - Plan is still the same.  Last I checked both Midgard and IOG teams are still making good progress on things, despite the fact that we have not withdrawn from the Cardano treasury in a very long time.  I don't think another 6 weeks while we pursue a better will slow progress meaningfully.\n\nCatalyst Funding - I'm not aware of these ecosystem teams that are \"fighting for survival\".  Catalyst has already been funded up through F13.  And how would any of these projects know that they would be approved for funding anyways?  IMHO a 6-week delay is perfectly fine.\n\nFlexibility of Governance - I'm aware that a new NCL can be passed that is lower.  However, I worry that once we have a high NCL passed, many of the top dReps who happen to have budget proposals will rigorously defend the high limit so that their proposals have a better chance.  Better to approve a low NCL and then raise it later if we have to IMHO.\n\nMarket Timing and Investment Windows - I don't think any of the budget proposals mentioned so far move the needle enough in a positive direction to be worth the ADA they are asking for.  What is the PMF we are trying to market?  What strategic initiatives other than ones in IOG's core proposal, Midgard, Starstream, Amaru, and Gerolamo are needed?  All of those combined are still less than 200M ADA.  Also, I support a stablecoin liquidity proposal, but it needs to be decoupled from Emurgo's omnibus proposal IMHO.\n\nChecks and Balances - The issue here is not necessarily that dReps will want to spend up to the cap.  It's that budget proposers will.  We don't have enough visibility into ANY of the proposals' true costs.  Example:  Maybe with a 150M NCL, IOG might propose 50M for their core proposal.  With 350M NCL, there is enough room for them to ask for 100M first just to see if it passes.  We WANT budget proposers to be *LIMITED* by the NCL to get them to compete to lower costs.\n\nMisuse Isn’t Solved by NCL Alone - Agreed.  But IMHO lowering the NCL will cause proposers to increase the *quality* of their proposals in order to compete with other proposers for a slice of a smaller pie.\n\nSelling Pressure and Timing - ADA is currently 5x below ATH.  I very much doubt that it will be on its way back down again 6 weeks from now.  In fact I think if we delay a little bit we'll be more likely to stretch the value of our ADA spent to go much further.\n\nThese are some of the main reasons I am strongly against approving a 350M NCL right now."

          "originalText": "My Rationale for Budget Proposals\n\nI supported 23 projects totaling 222.2M ADA. I voted NO for all others.\n\nNumber of supported projects across categories:\n\n• Core: 17\n• Research: 2\n• Marketing & Innovation: 2\n• Governance support: 2\n\nThe 3 largest projects I supported are IOG Core development, IO Research, and Catalyst. \n\nThese 3 items account for 193M ADA.\n\nI was hesitant to support IOG research. In the past, many academic papers have been published. We do not need all the research items on the list for next year. Now it is necessary to support implementation and the ecosystem more, which, in my opinion, is lagging behind research.\n\nOn the other hand, Cardano's success is largely based on research and quality implementation using formal methods. \n\nNot supporting research would be a step aside. Some of the things on the list may be implemented in the future.\n\nMy recommendation for next time is to create a separate proposal for each item instead of one proposal with many items. This also applies to Core development.\n\nAs I mentioned before, I consider Catalyst to be the place where most projects should apply for funding. That is why I support it.\n\nDuring the review of Budget Proposals, I noticed that in many cases, only about 2-3 DReps voted. In the best case, about 10, rarely around 20. This is a very low participation.\n\nCatalyst is not perfect, but it has been improved for several years, the team is experienced, and it is a battle-tested tool. ADA holders are already familiar with the system. Moreover, further improvements are planned.\n\nAt this point, I see no reason to replace Catalyst with Budget Proposals.\n\nMy other recommendation is that IOG should submit separate GAs for their proposals once the NCL is approved. This will avoid the situation where DReps vote on a GA with many other items in one GA.\n\nI only used 29M ADA to support the other 23 projects. \n\nThese are projects that, in my opinion, the ecosystem desperately needs.\n\nI consider Midgard, Starstream, Hydra, ZK Rollups, an alternative Cardano node, integration with Bitcoin, and several others to be must-have projects.\n\nIf I came across multiple similar proposals, I preferred open-source projects and entities that are well-known to the community or have delivered a project that is still in use today.\n\nI would like to emphasize that if I voted NO, it could mean:\n\n• I don't like the project. It shouldn't be funded from Treasury (or Catalyst).\n\n• I like the project, and it should apply for funding from Catalyst.\n\nIn general, I think that projects with ambitions to be commercially successful should look for other sources of funding. \n\nI don't like it when a risky business is funded from the Treasury, and in case of success, the profit is privatized.\n\nIf projects apply for Treasury funding, they should have a strategy on how to return part of the profit back to the community in case of success.\n\nFurthermore, I think that if it is a startup, the team cannot expect that devs will be paid the same salaries as IOG devs. Part of the risk must be borne by the team, not just Treasury.\n\nSome projects do not have a commercial character, for example, libraries, dev tools, etc. We should identify these projects, evaluate their benefits, and possibly support them.\n\nThe last major project I supported was the Marketing Strategy from the Cardano Foundation. This also includes the Cardano Summit.\n\nIn general, I do not want to support projects from founding entities that hold Genesis coins and have not spent them yet. The Cardano Foundation is such an entity, which was negatively reflected in the last Catalyst Fund.\n\nOn the other hand, this proposal was the best in the marketing category. The Cardano Foundation supports many activities in the ecosystem. CF wants to remain active in the long term and support building the ecosystem, for which it needs to secure funding.\n\nThe costs of the Cardano Summit and other marketing activities can be high. I would not like to risk that if their proposal is not approved, the next Cardano Summit will not be organized. The crypto industry could perceive this negatively.\n\nI have only supported a single proposal from Intersect regarding the budget for open-source development. They are asking for 5.8M ADA.\n\nNew proposals appear every day, so my decision may not be final.  I may make changes.\n\nMy DRep ID:\ndrep1km69g7ksf8t5g0h9d9tkrcd2tezxelx0wtr76rv2mrkl5nzd6v3"

          "text": "我对 Intersect 预算临时检查的投票 🗳️\n\n作为 DRep 职责的一部分，我想分享我的投票理由。我会尽量让解释简单明了，特别是对于那些可能还没有深入参与 Cardano 治理的人。\n\n我投票支持的内容\n\n我支持在以下战略领域提供资金：\n\n- 零知识 (ZK) 解决方案 (zkFold, ZK Bridge, Atlas PAB Hydra 集成等)\n\n- Cardano 节点开发和维护 (核心工程, Rust 节点, 维护提案)\n\n- 库和开发者工具 (Pallas, MLabs 库, Extended Symbolic, Lucid 等)\n\n- Bitcoin 互操作性 (完整的 Cardano-Bitcoin 桥接 Web3 堆栈)\n\n- Layer 2 扩展解决方案 (Midgard Rollups, Hydra 集成)\n\n反思与坦诚评估\n\n我想坦白：我无法深入分析每一项提案。\n\n我主要关注：\n\n- 生态系统中知名团队的提案\n\n- 我被直接要求分析的提案\n\n- 符合我对 Cardano 当前优先事项看法的提案\n\n鉴于提案数量庞大（近200项）以及我们 DReps 目前有限的时间和支持工具，这是一个紧张且不完美的过程。如果您认为我错过了一项重要的提案，请随时私信我——我很乐意再次审阅。\n\n预算分配摘要\n\n- 核心：190,222,949 - 55.11%\n- 研究：29,598,000 - 8.57%\n- 治理支持：111,643,123 - 32.34%\n- 营销：94,623,933 - 27.41%\n- 无：766,800 - 0.22%\n\n总计：345,161,209 ADA\n\n为何在营销上投入如此之多？\n\n有人可能会问我为什么支持大量的营销预算。\n\n我的看法很务实：\n\nCardano 目前更像是一家初创公司，而不是一个政府。\n\n在竞争激烈的加密货币环境中，增长至关重要。\n\n如果不能将一部分资金再投资于生态系统扩张，那么在财政库中积累数百万 ADA 意义不大。\n\n我会在未来的几轮中支持较小的营销预算，但错过2025-2026年的周期将是一个重大的战略错误。\n\n结论：明年的重点领域\n\nDReps 必须为所需的大量工作获得补偿。否则，DReps 就不会参与。\n\n更好的工具、人工智能支持和提案管理平台是强制性的。\n\nCatalyst 和宪法治理必须更好地整合，而不是各自为政。\n\n感谢所有提交提案、参与讨论并为这项庞大工作提供帮助的人。我们仍处于起步阶段——但这是一个充满希望的开端。\n\n如果您正在寻找 DREP，我的 ID 是：drep1y2jd3c4hgg0tdua58z6c64k9rf58lz3jlcjlxcjfeaspl6q2e9zm6\n\n我投票赞成的提案：\n\n- Cardano 维护和路线图交付提案：为整个 Cardano 社区确保 Ada 网络基础设施的安全\n- Input Output Research (IOR): Cardano 愿景 - 2025年工作计划\n- Cardano 生态系统的成员制组织：Intersect\n- 超越最低可行治理：迭代改进 Cardano Voltaire\n- Cardano 社区参与其治理的开源工具：Cardano Govtool\n- Cardano 产品委员会：社区驱动 - 通过研讨会和结构化产品研究收集2030年 Cardano 愿景和2026年路线图见解\n- 2025 Input Output 工程核心开发提案\n- UTxO RPC：维持 Cardano 区块链集成\n- Dolos：维持轻量级 Cardano 数据节点\n- Pallas：维持 Cardano 的关键 Rust 工具\n- MLabs 核心工具维护与增强：Ply\n- MLabs 核心工具维护与增强：CLB\n- MLabs 维护与增强：Atlas PAB\n- MLabs 核心工具维护与增强：Cardano Transaction Library (CTL)\n- MLabs 核心工具维护与增强：Plutarch\n- Extended Symbolic\n- Lucid Evolution 维护\n- OSC 预算提案 - 可持续发展的付费开源模式\n- zkFold ZK Rollup\n- Atlas PAB: Hydra 和 L2 集成 (Midgard, Midnight, ZkFold)\n- Blockfrost 平台社区预算提案\n- Extended UPLC Converter\n- 完整的 Web3 开发者堆栈，使 Cardano 成为 Bitcoin 的智能合约层\n- Midgard - Optimistic Rollups\n- Gerolamo - 用 typescript 编写的 Cardano 节点\n- Atlas PAB - Chainlink Oracle 集成\n- ZK Bridge\n- Atlas PAB: Aiken 和治理集成\n - Atlas PAB: Hydra 和 L2 集成 (Midgard, Midnight, ZkFold)\n- AdaStat.net Cardano 区块链浏览器\n- 质量保证：链上和链下审计\n- ADAspending.com - Cardano 财政浏览器 - 用于跟踪 Cardano 区块链上财政支出的开放数据源\n- DRep 激励框架\n- SyncGovHub：一个智能、透明且以行动为导向的 Cardano 治理平台\n- Cardano 宪法委员会的组建和与 SanchoNet 教育网络的治理培训\n- Cardano 治理 MCP：对治理数据的自然语言访问\n- Cardano 社区参与其治理的开源工具：Cardano Govtool\n- 成员与社区委员会 (MCC) - 全球社区中心扩展计划\n- Cardano 峰会2025和区域技术活动\n- Cardano Builder DAO\n- Cardano 的营销基础设施\n- Amplify Cardano：Rare Network 的社区主导活动基金\n- Amplify Cardano：Rare Network 的社区主导营销基金\n- Cardano 上的商业潜在客户开发\n- 展览会上的 Cardano 生态系统展馆\n- A.L.B.A. Network\n- Cardano 精选短视频营销计划\n- Input Output 的 Catalyst 2025提案：推进去中心化社区创新资金和基础设施\n- 增长与营销委员会 (GMC) 预算提案",

          "originalText": "My Vote on the Intersect Budget Temp Check 🗳️\n\nAs part of my responsibilities as a DRep, I would like to share my rationale for my votes. I’ll keep this explanation straightforward, especially for those who may not be deeply involved yet in Cardano governance.\n\nWhat I Voted For\n\nI am supporting funding in the following strategic areas:\n\n- Zero Knowledge (ZK) Solutions (zkFold, ZK Bridge, Atlas PAB Hydra Integrations, etc.)\n\n- Cardano Node Development and Maintenance (Core Engineering, Rust Nodes, Maintenance Proposals)\n\n- Libraries and Developer Tooling (Pallas, MLabs Libraries, Extended Symbolic, Lucid, etc.)\n\n- Bitcoin Interoperability (Complete Web3 stack for Cardano-Bitcoin bridge)\n\n- Layer 2 Scaling Solutions (Midgard Rollups, Hydra integrations)\n\nReflections and Honest Assessment\n\nI want to be honest: I could not deeply analyze every single proposal.\n\nI focused primarily on:\n\n- Proposals from well-recognized teams in the ecosystem\n\n- Proposals I was directly asked to analyze\n\n- Proposals aligned with my beliefs of Cardano’s current priorities\n\nGiven the sheer volume (almost 200 proposals) and the limited time and support tools we currently have as DReps, this was an intense and imperfect process.\nIf you think I missed an important proposal, feel free to DM me — I’m happy to review it again.\n\nBudget Distribution Summary\n\n- CORE: 190,222,949 - 55.11%\n- Research: 29,598,000 - 8.57%\n- Gov-Support: 111,643,123 - 32.34%\n- Marketing: 94,623,933 - 27.41%\n- None: 766,800 - 0.22%\n\nTotal: 345,161,209 ADA\n\nWhy So Much Into Marketing?\n\nSome may ask why I supported significant marketing budgets.\n\nMy view is pragmatic:\n\nCardano is not a government, it's closer to a startup at this stage.\n\nIn a highly competitive crypto environment, growth is critical.\n\nAccumulating millions of ADA in treasury means little if we do not reinvest part of it in ecosystem expansion.\n\nI would support smaller marketing budgets in future rounds, but missing the 2025-2026 cycle would be a major strategic mistake.\n\nConclusion: Focus Areas for Next Year\n\nDReps must be compensated for the massive amount of work required. If not, simply DReps will not participate\n\nBetter tooling, AI support, and proposal management platforms are mandatory.\n\nCatalyst and Constitutional Governance must be better integrated, not siloed.\n\nThank you to everyone who submitted proposals, participated in discussions, and helped in this massive effort. We are still at the beginning — but it’s a promising one.\n\nIF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A DREP MY ID IS: drep1y2jd3c4hgg0tdua58z6c64k9rf58lz3jlcjlxcjfeaspl6q2e9zm6\n\nProposals I voted YES for: \n\n- Cardano Maintenance and Roadmap Delivery Proposal: Secure Ada Network Infrastructure for the enTire cardano communitY\n- Input Output Research (IOR): Cardano Vision - Work Program 2025\n- A member-based organization for the Cardano ecosystem: Intersect\n- Beyond Minimum Viable Governance: Iteratively Improving on Cardano Voltaire\n- The Cardano community's open-source tool for participation in its governance: Cardano Govtool\n- Cardano Product Committee: Community-driven - 2030 Cardano Vision and 2026 roadmap insights collection via workshops and structured product research\n- 2025 Input Output Engineering Core Development Proposal\n- UTxO RPC: Sustaining Cardano Blockchain Integration\n- Dolos: Sustaining a Lightweight Cardano Data Node\n- Pallas: Sustaining Critical Rust Tooling for Cardano\n- MLabs Core Tool Maintenance & Enhancement: Ply\n- MLabs Core Tool Maintenance & Enhancement: CLB\n- MLabs Maintenance & Enhancement: Atlas PAB\n- MLabs Core Tool Maintenance & Enhancement: Cardano Transaction Library (CTL)\n- MLabs Core Tool Maintenance & Enhancement: Plutarch\n- Extended Symbolic\n- Lucid Evolution Maintenance\n- OSC Budget Proposal - Paid Open Source Model for Sustainable Development\n- zkFold ZK Rollup\n- Atlas PAB: Hydra and L2 Integration (Midgard, Midnight, ZkFold)\n- Blockfrost Platform Community Budget Proposal\n- Extended UPLC Converter\n- Complete Web3 developer stack to make Cardano the smart contract layer for Bitcoin\n- Midgard - Optimistic Rollups\n- Gerolamo - cardano node in typescript\n- Atlas PAB - Chainlink Oracle Integration\n- ZK Bridge\n- Atlas PAB: Aiken and Governance Integration\n - Atlas PAB: Hydra and L2 Integration (Midgard, Midnight, ZkFold)\n- AdaStat..net Cardano blockchain explorer\n- Quality Assurance: On-Chain & Off-Chain Audit\n- ADAspending,com - Cardano Treasury Explorer - An open data source for tracking treasury spending on the Cardano blockchain\n- DRep Incentivization Framework\n- SyncGovHub: An intelligent Transparent, and Action-Oriented Platform for Cardano Governance\n- Cardano Constitutional Committee Formation and - Governance Training with the SanchoNet Education Network\n- Cardano Governance MCP: natural language access to governance data\n- The Cardano community's open-source tool for participation in its governance: Cardano Govtool\n- Membership & Community Committee (MCC) - Global Community Hubs Expansion Program\n- Cardano Summit 2025 and regional tech events\n- Cardano Builder DAO\n- Marketing Infrastructure for Cardano\n- Amplify Cardano: Community-Led Events Fund by Rare Network\n- Amplify Cardano: Community-Led Marketing Fund by - Rare Network\n- Business Lead Generation on Cardano\n- Cardano Ecosystem Pavilions at Exhibitions\n- A.L.B.A. Network\n- Cardano Curation Short-Form Video Marketing Initiative\n- Catalyst 2025 Proposal by Input Output: Advancing Decentralised Community Innovation Funding & Infrastructure\n- Growth & Marketing Committee (GMC) Budget Proposal"

          "originalText": "✅ I voted YES for the Amaru project. \n\nMy Rationale\n\nNode diversity is critical for decentralization and network resilience. When multiple independent teams build node software, it reduces reliance on a single entity, such as IOG in the case of Cardano. \n\nIt minimizes the systemic risks associated with monoculture software development.\n\nOne of the core promises of blockchain networks is high availability, including strong resistance to attacks and censorship. \n\nWhile no system can guarantee 100% uptime, having multiple node implementations increases the network’s robustness. If a bug or vulnerability is present in one version, others may remain unaffected, limiting potential damage.\n\nEncouraging additional node implementations also deepens understanding of the protocol. As more developers build and maintain nodes, they contribute to refining the protocol specification, surfacing ambiguities, and improving long-term maintainability. \n\nThis also supports future clients by setting a clearer and more battle-tested standard.\n\nFor comparison, Bitcoin is largely dependent on a single implementation: Bitcoin Core. While there are alternatives (e.g., btcd, Bitcoin Knots), they are rarely used, making the network heavily reliant on a single development team. \n\nThis centralization becomes especially visible during governance disputes, such as those surrounding the use of the OP_RETURN opcode and Ordinals.\n\nIn contrast, Ethereum has multiple actively maintained implementations for both its consensus and execution layers. These include clients like Geth, Nethermind, Besu, Erigon (execution), and Prysm, Lighthouse, Teku, Nimbus (consensus). \n\nThis diversity has strengthened Ethereum's decentralization and made the network more resilient to bugs and performance issues in any single client.\n\nNode diversity, however, comes with challenges. \n\nDivergent implementations can lead to consensus bugs or temporary chain splits if not carefully tested. \n\nCoordinated testnets and protocol-level specification clarity are essential to mitigate these risks. \n\nProtocol upgrades may also take longer, as all implementations must integrate and validate changes, such as the upcoming Ouroboros Leios, which both IOG and Amaru nodes will need to support.\n\nSustained funding is another consideration. \n\nMaintaining multiple full node implementations is resource-intensive and will likely require long-term support from the Cardano Treasury. \n\nHowever, the cost is justified by the increased decentralization, security, and community participation that such diversity brings.\n\nThe Amaru team's funding request is reasonable, especially compared to the budgets that IOG requires. \n\nThe team includes respected developers from within the Cardano ecosystem and is supported by several reputable entities. Their proposed Rust-based node implementation would be a serious alternative to IOG’s Haskell-based Cardano node, marking a crucial step forward for ecosystem resilience.\n\nThis initiative strengthens decentralization, improves protocol robustness, and represents a healthy evolution of the Cardano network.\n\nMy DRep ID:\ndrep1km69g7ksf8t5g0h9d9tkrcd2tezxelx0wtr76rv2mrkl5nzd6v3"

Here’s a breakdown of the current situation:\n\n✅ Approved: The 2025 NCL of 350M ADA has been formally ratified by DReps. It’s based on a 2024 treasury income model (approx. 336M ADA) and now serves as the foundation for current budget deliberations.\n\n❌ Rejected: A more conservative proposal to cap 2025 at 300M ADA and 2026 at 250M ADA was not approved.\n\n🟠 Under Review:\n“2025 Cardano NCL” proposes lowering the NCL to 200M ADA, urging a cautious approach during this first year of decentralized treasury governance.\n“300M ADA for Epochs 563–635” aims to establish an NCL for early 2026, supporting budget continuity across overlapping periods.\n\nMeanwhile, several new funding proposals have been submitted:\n\n1⃣ 7.5M ADA for Community Builder Proposals — includes only those with ≥2.69B ADA support, excluding proposals from Intersect and founding entities.\n\n2⃣ 1.5M ADA for Amaru Rust Node Development — a PRAGMA-led initiative to diversify Cardano nodes and enhance network resilience.\n\n3⃣ 50M ADA for DeFi Liquidity — aims to seed liquidity into DEXs and stablecoins, with yield partially returned to the treasury.\n\nAs SIPO DRep, we’re evaluating these developments based on:\n\n🔍 Cautious governance: supports the 200M ADA NCL.\n🚀 Growth & momentum: supports maintaining the 350M ADA cap.\n⚖️ Balanced compromise: 300M ADA could be a pragmatic middle ground.\n\nFor funding proposals, our assessment will focus on:\nDoes it generate a return to the treasury?\nIs transparency and execution capacity ensured?\nDoes it set a strong precedent for the first year of decentralized financial governance?\n\nThe NCL is more than just a number — it reflects Cardano’s financial philosophy and growth trajectory. Changing the cap directly impacts which proposals are viable.\n\nWe’ll soon publish SIPO’s evaluation criteria and vote logic for each major proposal. In the meantime, we welcome your input before the voting begins.\n\nIf you support our work as a DRep, please consider delegating:\n\nDRep ID:\ndrep1yffld2866p00cyg3ejjdewtvazgah7jjgk0s9m7m5ytmmdq33v3zh\n\nFor Daedalus:\ndrep120m237kstm7pzywv5nwtjm8gj8dl55j9nupwlkapz77mgv7zu7l"

          "originalText": "As a DRep in the #Cardano ecosystem, I just voted YES on the @Amaru_Cardano proposal! \n I believe Amaru is one of the best actions we've seen so far because it operates independently from Intersect and aligns with the constitutional path. 💪\n Amaru brings node diversity, efficiency, and enhanced interoperability. all while prioritizing decentralization and high assurance.\n\nMy rationale:\n1. Node Diversity and Decentralization: The Amaru project addresses a critical need in the Cardano network by introducing a new block-producing node written in Rust. This increases resilience by reducing dependency on a single Haskell implementation, thereby enhancing the network's fault tolerance and decentralization.\n\n2. Performance and Efficiency: Amaru prioritizes better resource usage, including lower memory consumption and enhanced observability through industry-standard monitoring. This improvement benefits Stake Pool Operators (SPOs) by lowering hardware requirements, ultimately reducing operational costs.\n\n3. Enhanced Interoperability: The Rust-based approach not only attracts a wider pool of developers but also integrates seamlessly with existing blockchain solutions. This modular and flexible design expands the potential for future innovations and use cases within the Cardano ecosystem.\n\n4. High Assurance and Robustness: The development process of Amaru includes thorough conformance testing and the identification of inconsistencies in existing implementations. This meticulous approach contributes to the network's overall security and stability.\n\n5. Responsible Budget and Governance: The proposal demonstrates financial responsibility with a clear breakdown of Full-Time Employee (FTE) requirements and contingency planning. Moreover, the use of an on-chain smart contract for budget administration ensures transparency and accountability.\n\n6. Community-Driven and Open-Source: Amaru's open-source model, managed by PRAGMA—a reputable multi-entity effort—ensures community engagement and long-term maintenance. Regular updates and demos foster transparency and maintain community trust.\n\n Check out my voting transaction: https://t.co/xFStBmUKjs"

          "text": "🔥 #Cardano 治理更新 🔥\n\nCardano 的未来岌岌可危：更新、宪法、财政库和预算。\n\nPlomin 硬分叉\n\n此更新将是全面参与 Cardano 治理的最后一步，该治理由 CIP-1694 设计。预计 Plomin 硬分叉很快就会在链上提交。几个月前，当 Chang 硬分叉实施时，它激活了治理引导阶段，允许授权代表 (DReps) 在链上注册，并成立了宪法委员会 (CC) 与权益池运营商 (SPOs) 一起对治理行动 (GAs) 进行投票。然而，治理是有限的。\n\n一旦 Plomin 硬分叉通过，DReps 将获得完整的投票权，而不仅仅是对信息行动的投票权（请访问 https://t.co/aRWErA7Waj 查看不同类型治理行动的指南）。这意味着 Cardano 社区将能够更新 Cardano 宪法并从 Cardano 财政库中提取资金。\n\n我们为什么关心制定宪法和从财政库提取资金？坦率地说，这是因为 Cardano 已经成长起来，我们现在必须开始独立生活。当 Cardano 于 2017 年启动时，先驱实体获得了 Ada 的资助（约占总供应量的 20%），以便为我们提供一个我们用户可以自我治理的去中心化生态系统。现在我们拥有了治理权，我们需要坚定地制定基本规则，以保护 Cardano 生态系统中每个互动者的权利，我们需要共同决定 Cardano 未来的发展路线图，并且我们需要有办法为此付费！\n\n宪法\n\n过去几个月对 Cardano 来说是历史性的时刻，社区参与了起草新宪法的审议过程。虽然 Chang 硬分叉建立了一部临时宪法，但该文件是在有计划替换的情况下编写的。@IntersectMBO 在 @InputOutputHK、@Cardano_CF、@emurgo_io 和无数社区贡献者的帮助下，在全球举办了 63 场研讨会，从中选出了制宪会议的代表。这些代表参加了综合会议，审查了由 Intersect 的 Cardano 公民委员会起草的新宪法提案的语言，征求了社区对拟议修改的反馈，然后齐聚布宜诺斯艾利斯和内罗毕进行辩论并批准了最终草案。\n\n尽管如此，这部新宪法尚未获得批准！在像 Cardano 这样的区块链技术去中心化生态系统中，新宪法的建立必须得到 Ada 持有者（由其 DReps 代表）投票赞成后才能生效。一旦 Plomin 硬分叉通过（祈祷！），社区将能够考虑采取治理行动来批准新宪法。如果必须，我们可以继续在临时宪法下运作，但尽快转向一部源于社区审查程序的新宪法将是更可取的。\n\n财政库\n\nCardano 最独特和最强大的方面之一是我们拥有一个共同的财政库，用于支持区块链生态系统的运营、维护和未来发展。每个 Epoch，奖励池的 20%（交易费和货币扩张）会进入财政库，其余部分则用于权益奖励。\n\n由于该财政库的资金来源于本应属于 Cardano 社区成员的权益奖励，因此必须对其进行保护。这就是为什么临时宪法和拟议宪法都规定，在进行任何财政库提款之前，必须通过治理信息行动批准净变化限额。\n\n社区采用的净变化限额必须规定在特定时间内可以从财政库中支出多少 Ada。出于实际目的（至少在我们开始时），这很可能意味着我们决定在 73 个 epoch（一个日历年）内支出多少。由于 CC 有义务否决任何不符合既定净变化限额的财政库提款 GA，因此我们必须确保该值符合我们当年的计划支出，并考虑到可能出现的意外情况。这需要巧妙的平衡！\n\n预算\n\n除了净变化限额之外，临时宪法和拟议宪法还规定，任何财政库提款 GA 都必须符合 Cardano 社区通过 DReps 投票批准的预算，否则无法通过。CC 还必须对任何拟议预算进行投票，以确保拟议支出不违反宪法。\n\n宪法文本中的预算要求特意保持灵活性，以便为 Cardano 社区提供资助去中心化生态系统的多种选择。临时宪法仅规定必须有某个预算存在，而拟议宪法则更明确地描述了每个预算必须有一名管理人，以确保财政库提款得到妥善使用。该管理人可以是个人、机构或智能合约，我预计这种做法会随着时间的推移而发展。\n\n虽然 Cardano 上的任何人都可以提出预算，但大量的社区努力一直集中在与 @IntersectMBO 合作，提出一项支持 Cardano 2025 年的全面预算。这一过程已接近完成，预算委员会表示他们很快就会向社区报告其提案。他们已经举行了多次社区会议，描述了这一过程并征求了反馈。\n\nIntersect 方法的关键之一是确保没有单一个人负责资金管理。Intersect 将提出的预算会将管理人职责分配给由 Cardano 社区成员运营的 Intersect 各个委员会。再次强调，我们正在寻求在去中心化的好处与赋权于民以实现更大利益是推动进程的最佳方式这一认知之间取得平衡。\n\n时间表与结论\n\n既然我们已经清楚 Cardano 未来需要发生什么，我们就可以讨论每项行动的时间安排。每次提出治理行动时，Cardano 社区都有 6 个 Epoch（30 天）的时间进行投票，然后 GA 需要一个 Epoch 才能生效。虽然大多数行动可以提前通过（如果它们获得了必要的赞成票门槛），但最好保守估计投票将持续整个可能的时间长度。\n\n如果 Plomin 硬分叉 GA 于 12 月 21 日（Cardano Epoch 529 开始之日）提交，我们预计它可能会在 1 月 24 日（Epoch 536）生效。届时，也只有到那时，我们才能合理地提交宪法以供批准。财政库也将解锁，DReps 可以考虑财政库提款治理行动。\n\n虽然财政库将于 1 月 24 日解锁（前提是 Plomin 硬分叉 GA 通过），但在净变化限额和至少一项预算获得批准之前，CC 不会批准 DReps 提取资金的任何行动。这意味着我们需要让 DReps 和 CC 对治理信息行动进行投票以批准这些项目，然后才能提交任何财政库提款。\n\n幸运的是，由于 DReps 目前能够对信息行动进行投票，我们无需等待 Plomin 硬分叉生效即可开始这些讨论。社区可以在同一时间窗口内考虑并对硬分叉、净变化限额和拟议预算进行投票。我们有很多重要问题需要解决，但我相信我们能够克服它们，并展示去中心化治理如何使一个排名前十的区块链生态系统不仅能够运作，而且能够蓬勃发展！\n\n如果你和我一样是区块链治理的爱好者，那么你读到这里可能一直在点头，并且一直参与其中。如果你刚刚接触这个领域并且读到了这里，我希望你能加入我们，共同迈出旅程的下一步。无论如何，假期好好休息一下，因为一月份对于 Cardano 来说将是一个激动人心的时刻！",

          "originalText": "🔥 #Cardano Governance Update 🔥\n\nWhat's at stake for the future of Cardano: The Update, The Constitution, the Treasury, and the Budgets.\n\nThe Plomin Hard Fork \n\nThis update will be the final step to full participation in Cardano Governance as designed by CIP-1694. Expect to see the Plomin Hard Fork submitted on chain very soon.  A few months ago, when the Chang Hard Fork was enacted, it activated the Governance Bootstrap Phase which allowed Delegated Representatives (DReps) to register on-chain and established the Constitutional Committee (CC) to vote on Governance Actions (GAs) along with Stake Pool Operators (SPOs).  However, governance was limited.\n\nOnce the Plomin Hard Fork passes the DReps will gain full voting power, not just the ability to vote on Info Actions (visit https://t.co/aRWErA7Waj for a guide to the different type of Governance Actions).  This means that the Cardano Community will be able to update the Cardano Constitution and withdraw funds from the Cardano Treasury.\n\nWhy do we care about establishing the Constitution and withdrawing funds from the Treasury?  Well, quite frankly, it's because Cardano has grown up and we have to start living on our own now.  When Cardano was launched in 2017 the pioneering entities were given grants of Ada (about 20% of the total supply) in order to deliver us a decentralized ecosystem that the we, the users, could govern ourselves.  Now that we have the power of governance we need to firmly set the ground rules that protects the rights of everyone who interacts in the Cardano ecosystem, we need to collectively decide on the future development roadmap of Cardano, and we need to have a way to pay for it!\n\nThe Constitution\n\nThe past few months have been a historic time for Cardano as the community engaged in a deliberative process to draft a new Constitution.  While an Interim Constitution had been established with the Chang Hard Fork that document was written with an intentional plan for replacement.  @IntersectMBO with the help of @InputOutputHK, @Cardano_CF, @emurgo_io, and countless community contributors held 63 workshops across the world where Delegates for a Constitutional Convention were selected. These Delegates participated in synthesis sessions to review the language of the proposed new constitution that had been drafted by the Cardano Civics Committee of Intersect, solicited community feedback on proposed changes, and then came together in Buenos Aires and Nairobi to debate and approve a final draft.\n\nAll that being said, this new Constitution is not yet approved!  In a decentralized ecosystem of blockchain technology like Cardano, the establishment of a new Constitution cannot be valid until the Ada holders, as represented by their DReps, vote in favor.  Once the Plomin Hard Fork has passed (fingers crossed!) the community will be able to consider a Governance Action to ratify the new Constitution.  We can continue to operate under the Interim Constitution, if we must, but it would be far preferable to move to a new Constitution that came from a community review process as soon as possible.\n\nThe Treasury\n\nOne of the most unique and powerful aspects of Cardano is that we have a common Treasury to provide for the operation, maintenance, and future development of the blockchain ecosystem. Each Epoch, 20% of the Rewards Pool (transaction fees and monetary expansion) goes to the Treasury instead while the rest goes to Staking Rewards.\n\nBecause this Treasury comes out of the Staking Rewards that would otherwise go to the members of the Cardano Community, it is essential that the fund be safeguarded.  That is why the Interim Constitution and the proposed Constitution both specify that a Net Change Limit must be approved through a Governance Info Action before any Treasury Withdrawals are made.\n\nThe Net Change Limit that is adopted by the community must define how much Ada can be spent out of the Treasury in a certain amount of time.  For practical purposes (at least as we start), this will most likely mean that we decide how much to spend in 73 epochs (a calendar year).  Because the CC is obligated to vote down any Treasury Withdrawal GA that does not fit within the established Net Change Limit, we must make sure that this value fits within our planned spending for the year and allows for contingencies that may come up.  There is a fine balance to be struck!\n\nThe Budgets\n\nIn addition to the Net Change Limit, the Interim Constitution and the proposed Constitution specify that the no Treasury Withdrawal GA can pass unless it fits within a Budget that has been approved by the Cardano community through a vote by DReps.  The CC must also vote on any proposed budget to ensure that proposed spending does not violate the Constitution.\n\nWith text of the Constitution, the Budget requirements are purposefully flexible to give the Cardano Community options to fund the decentralized ecosystem.  While the Interim Constitution simply says there must be some Budget in place, the proposed Constitution is a bit more explicit in describing how each Budget must have an Administrator to ensure Treasury Withdrawals are properly spent.  This Administrator could be a person, an institution, or a smart contract, and I expect we will see this practice evolve over time.\n\nWhile anyone on Cardano can propose a budget, a large amount of community effort has been focused on working with @IntersectMBO to propose a comprehensive budget to support Cardano in 2025.  This process is nearing completion and the Budget Committee has stated they will be ready to report their proposal to the community soon.  They have already held numerous community meetings describing the process and soliciting feedback.\n\nOne of the keys to Intersect's approach will be to ensure that there is no single person in charge of the administration of funds.  The Budgets that Intersect will propose will give Administrator responsibilities to various committees of Intersect that are run by Cardano community members.  Again, we are seeking to balance the benefits of decentralization with the recognition that empowering people to act for the greater good is the best way to move a process forward.\n\nThe Timeline & Conclusion\n\nNow that we have a clear picture on what needs to happen for Cardano to move forward, we can discuss the timing of each action. Each time a Governance Action is proposed the Cardano community has 6 Epochs (30 days) to vote on it and then it takes one Epoch for the GA to take effect.  While most actions can pass early (if they get the necessary threshold of Yes votes) it is best to make a conservative estimate that the vote will run the full length of time possible.\n\nIf the Plomin Hard Fork GA is submitted on December 21 (the beginning of Cardano Epoch 529) we are looking at probable enactment on January 24 (Epoch 536).  Then, and only then, can we reasonably submit the Constitution for ratification.  The Treasury will also be unlocked and DReps can consider Treasury Withdrawal Governance Actions.\n\nWhile the Treasury will be unlocked on January 24, provided that the Plomin Hard Fork GA passes, the CC will not approve any actions the DReps take to withdraw funds unless the Net Change Limit and at least one Budget have been approved.  That means that we will need to have the DReps and CC vote on Governance Info Actions to approve these items before any Treasury Withdrawals are submitted.\n\nFortunately, because DReps are able to vote for Info Actions right now, we do not need to wait for the Plomin Hard Fork to be enacted to begin these discussions.  The community can consider and vote on the Hard Fork, the Net Change Limit, and the proposed Budgets within the same window of time.  We have a lot of important issues to figure out but I am confident that we can work through them and show how decentralized governance can make a Top-10 Blockchain ecosystem not just function but thrive!\n\nIf you're a Blockchain Governance nerd like me, you've probably been nodding along as you read this and have been along for the ride up to this point.  If you're just getting into it and have read this far, I hope you'll join us for the next big step of the journey.  Either way, get some rest over the holidays, because January is going to be an exciting time for Cardano!"

          "originalText": "I announce that I intend to vote NO ❌on the governance action regarding the Net Change Limit for 2025 and 2026 in a few days.\n\n🚨Please redelegate to another Cardano DRep if you wish that your stake counts towards a YES or ABSTAIN vote. 🚨\n\n- I have read the governance info action and I welcome its submission and the reasonable proposal that was put forward.\n- I was originally inclined to vote YES, as we could face a period of analysis paralysis and the proposal seemed reasonable enough.\n- I continued to follow the debate about the proposed governance info action \"Set 2025 Net Change Limit of 300M ADA, 2026 Net Change Limit of 250M ADA\".\n- However, Cardano constitution does not explicitly define what is a Net Change Limit (NCL). Different participants have shown that they may have different understandings of the meaning. Some do not understand it. Does NCL include inflows and/or outflows into the treasury? How is NCL calculated exactly? The precise definition is unclear. Voting YES until this is cleared up in the constitution could result in poorly understood actions leading to unexpected consequences. This could jeopardize the stability of the Cardano monetary system. Of course, this not the fault of the proposers of this governance action. Their governance action helped to uncover this lack of precision in the Cardano constitution.\n- The proposed governance action proposes setting the NCL close to the maximum projected inflows into the treasury. The maximum inflows are forecast to be 300M ADA in 2025 and 265M ADA in 2026. On the face of it, it is a relatively reasonable proposal to set the NCL to 300M ADA in 2025 and to 250M ADA in 2026.\n- I do not think there is a need to set the NCL for 2026 at this moment in time. Although I welcome the idea of making it no higher than the inflows.\n- Through this vote rationale I am also signaling that even if I do vote for a motion that sets the NCL to 300M ADA in 2025 and 250M ADA in 2026, it is not likely that I will vote for a Cardano annual budget and withdrawals that are as high as 300M ADA in 2025.\n- Hence, I would prefer to see a proposal of a smaller NCL for 2025, probably 200-250M ADA. This will help focus the budgetary discussion on essentials.\n- I also have to consider that Catalyst has been allocated 150M ADA for three funds in 2024. Not all of this has been disbursed as the Catalyst payments are milestone based and some Catalyst projects give up or just stall. Many payments still take place in 2025. The proposed NCL for 2025 of 300M ADA is twice the size of what was allocated to Catalyst in 2024.\n- I also agree with suggestions that I think the Net Change Limit (NCL) could be linked to or calculated based on net treasury revenue for the previous 73 epochs.  This was proposed by Cardano DRep CardanoYoda: \"If the NCL is set to, for example, 80% and Treasury revenue for the last year was 300M ADA, 240M ADA could be spent.\" The advantages of this solution are that it is not necessary to project future Treasury revenue. A similar idea was floated by Cardano community member Max Capacity in the TECH SPO Discord: \" Monte Carlo simulations for estimating forward value? There's just so much variability and it opens it up to second guessing and even more wasted time and energy. Just use the prior year and no one can argue anything and you have certainty on Dec 31 reach year. I also like the last 73 epoch idea because it then means you don't have to stick to the calendar periodicity. Maybe the budget runs June to July. \""

A lot can happen between now and 2026, setting a 2026 limit seems premature - hence a bad precedent. \nI welcome the attempt by the proposers to highlight a need for conservative spending, by roughly limiting the NCL to the volume of of Cardano annual treasury inflows in 2025 and 2026."

I will consider every DRep that votes against this as not wanting to move forward and I would urge every delegator of such Drep to switch to one that wants Cardano to succeed in the coming time!\n\nRationale:\n\"The proposed amount strikes a good balance between enabling Cardano's continued development, growth, and a buffer for potential price depreciation on one hand, and preserving adequate treasury funds on the other. Approving this NCL is by no means a mandate to spend the entire amount. Budget proposals will only be approved if deemed appropriate, and individual treasury withdrawals will be assessed with regard to the ADA price. We should seize the time—now is the time to act; in the future, we may shift to a more conservative NCL approach.\"\n\nAlso happy to see the gov action stating exactly what the NCL means to avoid confusion btw. 👏👏"

          "originalText": "Let me explain the Net Change Limit in context.\n\nThe Net Change Limit (NCL) serves as a prevention against excessive withdrawal of ADA from the Treasury.\n\nThe NCL defines the maximum amount of ADA that can be withdrawn from the Treasury in a given period. This period is usually one year, which corresponds to 72 epochs.\n\nThe NCL can be defined as the amount of ADA for a given period. An alternative approach would be to express it as a percentage of Treasury revenue for a given past period.\n\nFor example, as 80% of Treasury revenue for the last 72 epochs.\n\nIt is up to the community to choose what they like best. \n\nThe first approach is more flexible because it is necessary to approve the NCL every year. The second approach could work in the long term without annual approval.\n\nThe NCL must be approved through governance action before it is possible to submit a proposal for withdrawal of ADA from the Treasury.\n\nThe NCL applies to all withdrawals from the Treasury in a given period.\n\nOnce the total number of ADA individually withdrawn from the Treasury reaches the defined NCL, further withdrawals exceeding the limit will become unconstitutional.\n\nThere is currently no NCL defined, so withdrawals are not possible.\n\nThere are two governance actions regarding NCL for next year.\n\nThe first one submitted by the community tries to set the NCL at 300M ADA. The second one from intersect sets 350M ADA.\n\nThere are currently 1.71B ADA in the Cardano Treasury.\n\nRevenues to the treasury consist of monetary expansion and fees. Fees are currently almost negligible. \n\nMost of the revenues consist of monetary expansion, i.e. the gradual transfer of ADA from the reserve to the Treasury.\n\nThere are currently 7.2B ADA in the reserve. The reserve is used to pay out staking rewards and deposit ADA into the Treasury.\n\nThe reserve is gradually trending towards 0. With each subsequent epoch, the reserve is decreasing. \n\nTreasury revenues will depend on fees and possibly other alternative revenues in the future.\n\nNCL is to prevent the rapid depletion of the Treasury, as ADA should be used to grow the ecosystem. \n\nBy this you can imagine a payment to IOG for the delivery of Ouroboros Leios, but also, for example, minting stablecoins. Basically, anything that the community approves.\n\nThere is a consensus that expenses should not be higher than Treasury revenues. NCL should reflect this. However, it is theoretically possible to approve NCL higher than Treasury revenues.\n\nAn important aspect of NCL is the direct negative impact on the market price of ADA. Entities that receive ADA from the Treasury can sell coins on the market to cover their living expenses.\n\nSelling pressure can harm SPOs and stakers.\n\nUltimately, this can also have a negative impact on Treasury, because if the market price of ADA is low in a bear market, it will be necessary to sell even more ADA in the coming years.\n\nIt is necessary to find a balance between the potential long-term positive impact of the investment and the medium-term market price of ADA.\n\nNCL does not mean that we have to spend a defined maximum. It is possible to approve an NCL of 350M ADA, but still, only 200M ADA can be approved in total spending in a given period.\n\nNCL is only an insurance against exceeding the limit. \n\nMore important are individual withdrawals. Each of them must be justified and we must be sure that the investment will have a positive impact on the ecosystem from the long-term perspective."

The proposers have stated that from January 5th, 2024, Epoch 459, through December 30th, Epoch 531, the actual total income into the Cardano Treasury was 335,957,093 ada.\n\nThe proposed NCL is 350M ada. This is roughly 14M ada higher than the total income in the Cardano Treasury for 2024. I welcome the proposed reference to modelling and the reference to a previous period for which we have data. \n\nThe motion uses modelling of ADA inflow for the previous year as the main basis for approving an NCL. It is indeed one of the factors that must be considered.\n \nWhat I am missing in this proposal - as it proposes a relatively large NCL - is even a minor economic analysis of how approvals of different NCLs could impact the valuation of ADA. An NCL of 350M ADA is sending a signal to the market. What is this signal? \n\nHow does it compare to previous signals? If we do not have the data, is there room for a prediction at least?\nWith the lack of this economic/monetary analysis, we are left to speculate. My feeling is that NCL approvals in the future will become defining moments that shape the ADA exchange rate vs the USD. It is a signal how much ADA could be released - a signal approved by the majority of DReps. \n\nThe approval of a large NCL could have an immediate price impact on the value of ADA, thus diminishing the purchase power of the 350M ADA. Before the budget elements are approved. \n\nAfter approving a large NCL, the budgetary discussions will probably take place in the shadow of a lower ADA/USD exchange rate. Thus we might be forced by the market to push an annual budget towards the top limit of the NCL. We could create a self-fulfilling prophesy. \n\nThe problem I see with a very large first year NCL is that our budgetary and governance processes are the weakest and most inefficient in the first year. Our ability to audit, prevent waste and abuse are questionable. A lower NCL would focus minds.\n\nWithout a monetary/economic analysis or forecast, I would consider voting for a NCL in the 200-250M ADA in 2025 (depending on the text of the NCL proposal) as it would give a better signal to the market about our intentions to balance the development of the system and the intention to safeguard the value of ADA and Cardano's Top 10 position. Especially, as our abilities to manage the potential spending of so much ADA in the early days of decentralized governance are the lowest. \n\nI see this conservative approach as something that protects the interests of ADA holders and stakers. \n\nBest practice: We SHOULD approve the closest NCL to the actual budget that we want as DReps. By approving a much larger NCL we will be devaluing the ada currency BEFORE any budget is approved and before the contractors receive the ADA. Effectively crippling ourselves unnecessarily. \n\nIf the intention is to approve a lower budget than 350M ada as some (many?) DReps seem to have indicated, then to preserve the value of that ada for those who will receive it, the best thing we can do is to vote for an NCL that is closest to that intended 2025 budget total."

          "originalText": "Maybe rather than tweeting about treasury spending at a high level, I can clarify what some of the spending is that I would actually vote YES for on-chain currently (ie not via off-chain processes, which I’m not a fan of), if asked to do so.\n\nAs always, please delegate to someone else if my approach is not in line with yours:\n\nNCL\nA reasonable NCL would in my mind ideally be below 150m, but to be pragmatic I’m willing to sign off on <= 200m. My reasons for this are well documented, but primarily relate to the emissions-price pressure-value add relationships.\n\nCore dev\nA reasonable proposal by IOG to keep delivering on critical roadmap items would get my instant support. In my view the one we have seen on gov tools ticks that box, if with a slightly hefty ask. Also assuming no surprises, I’d approve associated forks and changes. \n\nI am aware others besides IOG could do some of the work, but I think a safe approach in the first years of governance would be to only gradually diversify the work beyond IOG, rather than pull away from them immediately. Again, being conservative.\n\nHigh impact cost efficient proposals\nCost efficient, high impact technology efforts by other, ideally proven, actors. Think Midgard, Starstream or alternative nodes for single digit millions of ADA. Willing to entertain all similar impact and cost efficient ones.\n\nOrgs\nAssorted spending for Intersect and similar orgs pushing Cardano forward, if the asks are reasonable and well documented / detailed. Smaller asks will naturally be an easier yes.\n\nCatalyst and/or Intersect budget\nA slimmed down version of Catalyst to capture a lot of the efforts others want to put forward. Catalyst is a system that is not perfect, but is improving (eg quadratic voting) and is the current best framework we have for such things. Intersect might complement this, but needs to prove itself.\n\nSummary\nThis covers core tech, non core tech innovation, orgs and all the other proposals via Intersect/Catalyst.\n\nI think at a high level it should in principle be possible to fit all the above into a NCL of 150m ADA, though that would require some frugality on the part of all participants.\n\nMy stance on governance is that it should be transparent and on-chain wherever possible. I am currently unsure whether the Intersect budget process is as robust as what we have in place with Catalyst, and in any case it would need to prove itself.\n\nTherefore my preference would be to pull some of the tech related ones that I mentioned out of this process, and put them to a direct DRep vote fairly soon. Shrink down both Catalyst/Intersect budgets significantly and put them to a vote. I’ll likely support them."

          "text": "作为一名 DRep，我尚未对当前将2025年净变化限额 (NCL) 设定为3.5亿 ADA 的 GA 提案进行投票。我推迟投票的一个关键原因是我在等待一个设定较低 NCL 的替代提案——一个对我们第一个财政预算周期来说更合理和可持续的方案。\n\n我们之所以提出第二个提案，是因为第一个提案包含了多个大幅度的增长。虽然第二个提案解决了一些问题，但它也引入了新的复杂性，使包括我在内的许多 DReps 陷入困境。\n\n感觉好像有一种压力，要我们仅仅因为第一个提案失败就接受第二个提案。但这种想法是有缺陷的。仅仅因为一个提案没有通过，并不意味着下一个提案，无论其缺陷如何，都应该被默认接受。\n\n我相信3.5亿 ADA 太高了。我的立场是，一个更负责任的范围应该在1.5亿到2亿 ADA 之间。作为我们有史以来的第一个年度预算，我们必须从适度、现实的数字开始，并根据影响、效率和社区反馈的证据逐步扩大规模。\n\n是的，NCL 是一个上限，而不是支出的保证——但是一旦设定了上限，人性和机构行为往往会以达到上限为目标。现在批准3.5亿可能会为未来更高的预算设定先例，无论资金是否得到有效利用。\n\n我相信社区应该得到第三个，更平衡的提案。它早就该提出了——我们这周就需要它。\n\n让我们为财政治理奠定坚实的基础。一个植根于问责制、可扩展性和社区共识的基础。\n\n#CardanoCommunity #Cardanogovernance #DReps",

          "originalText": "As a DRep, I’ve not yet voted on the current GA proposal to set the 2025 Net Change Limit (NCL) at 350 million ADA. One key reason I’m holding off is in anticipation of an alternative proposal that sets a lower NCL—something more reasonable and sustainable for our first treasury budget cycle.\n\nWe arrived at a second proposal because the first included multiple steep increases. While the second addressed some concerns, it also introduced new complexities, leaving many DReps—myself included—in a difficult position.\n\nIt feels as though there's pressure to accept the second proposal simply because the first failed. But that mindset is flawed. Just because one proposal doesn't pass doesn’t mean the next one, regardless of its flaws, should be accepted by default.\n\nI believe 350M ADA is too high. My position is that a more responsible range would be between 150M and 200M ADA. As our first ever annual budget, we must start with modest, realistic figures and scale up based on evidence of impact, efficiency, and community feedback.\n\nYes, the NCL is a ceiling and not a guarantee of expenditure—but human nature and institutional behavior often aim for the ceiling once it’s in place. Approving 350M now could set the precedent for even higher future budgets, regardless of whether the funds are effectively used.\n\nI believe the community deserves a third, more balanced proposal. It’s overdue—and we need it this week.\n\nLet’s set a strong foundation for treasury governance. One rooted in accountability, scalability, and community consensus.\n\n#CardanoCommunity #Cardanogovernance #DReps"

Without the approved NCL, how do you expect teams like IOG or Midgard to cover ongoing development costs? Are you not concerned that this might slow down or even stall progress?\n\n• Catalyst Funding: The next Catalyst round is on hold, awaiting a budget decision. Essential ecosystem teams are already at risk of fighting for survival. Is that an acceptable trade-off?\n\n• Flexibility of Governance: Are you aware that a new Governance Action (GA) proposing a lower NCL can be submitted at any time? If so, why is NCL = 350M ADA perceived as so threatening?\n\n• Market Timing and Investment Windows: The current bull market won’t last forever. Now is the ideal time to mint stablecoins, run marketing campaigns, and support strategic initiatives. By the end of 2025, it may be too late. Isn’t it prudent to act while conditions are favorable?\n\n• Checks and Balances: Why assume total spending will automatically reach the NCL cap? DReps are tasked with voting on the budget and treasury withdrawals. ADA holders can monitor their choices and redelegate if necessary. Isn’t this an effective safeguard?\n\n• Misuse Isn’t Solved by NCL Alone: Even under a lower NCL, poorly designed or fraudulent projects may still get approved. Isn’t it more productive to focus on improving the quality of Budget Proposals rather than capping available funds?\n\n• Selling Pressure and Timing: Teams would receive a higher USD value if they sell ADA near an all-time high. While that scenario may still play out, the crypto market is notoriously unpredictable. Spreading withdrawals over time reduces sell pressure. Does it really make sense to delay spending until the end of 2025?\n\nI welcome constructive dialogue. My intent is not to polarize but to ensure that all dimensions of this decision are fully considered."

          "originalText": "@JaromirTesar \n\nScalability and Funding - Plan is still the same.  Last I checked both Midgard and IOG teams are still making good progress on things, despite the fact that we have not withdrawn from the Cardano treasury in a very long time.  I don't think another 6 weeks while we pursue a better will slow progress meaningfully.\n\nCatalyst Funding - I'm not aware of these ecosystem teams that are \"fighting for survival\".  Catalyst has already been funded up through F13.  And how would any of these projects know that they would be approved for funding anyways?  IMHO a 6-week delay is perfectly fine.\n\nFlexibility of Governance - I'm aware that a new NCL can be passed that is lower.  However, I worry that once we have a high NCL passed, many of the top dReps who happen to have budget proposals will rigorously defend the high limit so that their proposals have a better chance.  Better to approve a low NCL and then raise it later if we have to IMHO.\n\nMarket Timing and Investment Windows - I don't think any of the budget proposals mentioned so far move the needle enough in a positive direction to be worth the ADA they are asking for.  What is the PMF we are trying to market?  What strategic initiatives other than ones in IOG's core proposal, Midgard, Starstream, Amaru, and Gerolamo are needed?  All of those combined are still less than 200M ADA.  Also, I support a stablecoin liquidity proposal, but it needs to be decoupled from Emurgo's omnibus proposal IMHO.\n\nChecks and Balances - The issue here is not necessarily that dReps will want to spend up to the cap.  It's that budget proposers will.  We don't have enough visibility into ANY of the proposals' true costs.  Example:  Maybe with a 150M NCL, IOG might propose 50M for their core proposal.  With 350M NCL, there is enough room for them to ask for 100M first just to see if it passes.  We WANT budget proposers to be *LIMITED* by the NCL to get them to compete to lower costs.\n\nMisuse Isn’t Solved by NCL Alone - Agreed.  But IMHO lowering the NCL will cause proposers to increase the *quality* of their proposals in order to compete with other proposers for a slice of a smaller pie.\n\nSelling Pressure and Timing - ADA is currently 5x below ATH.  I very much doubt that it will be on its way back down again 6 weeks from now.  In fact I think if we delay a little bit we'll be more likely to stretch the value of our ADA spent to go much further.\n\nThese are some of the main reasons I am strongly against approving a 350M NCL right now."

          "text": "DREP 投票理由 🗳️🗳️\n\n提案：2025年净变化限额\n\n投票理由 – 2025年净变化限额 (NCL)\n\n我对此治理行动投赞成票——并非因为它完美无缺，而是因为拥有3.5亿 ₳ 的预算总比未来几个月没有任何预算要好。我们承受不起治理僵局。生态系统需要连续性，尤其是在我们迈入链上决策新时代之际。3.5亿 ₳ 仍然是一个巨大的数字，我更倾向于在2025年支出2.5亿 ₳。\n\n话虽如此，这里有一些细微差别：\n\n这应该是一个百分比，而不是一个固定的年度数字。财政流入的百分比使我们保持灵活性并与网络增长保持一致。硬性限制很快就会过时并束缚我们的手脚——这对于像区块链治理这样的动态环境来说并不理想。\n\n我已经对2025 + 2026 NCL 组合提案投了反对票。为什么？因为在没有更深入分析或灵活性的情况下将我们锁定在2026年，对于一个新的治理体系来说不是一个可持续的策略。每年都应该根据新的数据和需求进行建模和讨论——而不是捆绑和仓促行事。\n\n虽然我对2025年的3.5亿 ₳ NCL 投了赞成票，但我计划在预算审查中保持严谨。这意味着我很可能会支持高达3亿 ₳ 的提款作为制衡，推动财政责任和以影响为导向的资金投入。预算往往会扩大到其上限，这就是我进行这种制衡的原因。尽管很可能只是象征性的。\n\n所以是的——这次投票是战略性的，而非热情洋溢的。它是为了让 Cardano 继续前进，同时坚守价值、问责制和进步的底线。\n\nVOTE0007",

          "originalText": "DREP Voting Rationale 🗳️🗳️\n\nProposal: 2025 Net Change Limit\n\nVoting Rationale – 2025 Net Change Limit (NCL)\n\nI'm voting YES on this governance action — not because it's perfect, but because having a 350M ₳ budget is better than having no budget at all for the months ahead. We can't afford a governance deadlock. The ecosystem needs continuity, especially as we step into a new era of on-chain decision-making. 350M ₳ its still a huge number, I would be more comfortable with spending 250M ₳ in 2025.\n\nThat said, here's some nuance:\n\nThis should have been a percentage, not a fixed yearly number. A percentage of treasury inflows keeps us flexible and aligned with network growth. Hard limits age quickly and tie our hands — not great for dynamic environments like blockchain governance.\n\nI already voted NO on the 2025 + 2026 NCL combo proposal. Why? Because locking ourselves into 2026 without deeper analysis or flexibility is not a sustainable strategy for a new governance system. Each year should be modeled and discussed based on fresh data and needs — not bundled and rushed.\n\nWhile I’m voting YES on the 350M ₳ NCL for 2025, I plan to be disciplined in budget reviews. That means I’ll most likely supporting withdrawals up to 300M ₳ as a counterbalance, pushing for fiscal responsibility and impact-driven funding. Budgets tend to expand to its upper limit, that's why I'm doing this counterbalance. Although most likely a symbolic one.\n\nSo yes — this vote is strategic, not enthusiastic. It's about keeping Cardano moving while holding the line on value, accountability, and progress.\n\nVOTE0007"

We need an NCL. Voting on this Info Action is open right now: https://t.co/y2QhpF7s30\n\nAdditional thoughts:\n\n- Approving this limit is the shortest path to getting builders funded in the Cardano ecosystem. If we propose an arbitrarily smaller NCL info action, it will need to go through approval and will delay this process by another month. \n\n- This NCL creates a cap of what we can possibly spend in the coming year. This does not mean we are approving a ₳350M withdrawal (or any withdrawal at this time) from the Cardano Treasury.\n\n- This Info Action already has 50%+ approval from the DReps, and its approval allows us to start the process of funding projects building on Cardano.\n\n-  This net change limit value is about equivalent to the income of the Cardano Treasury in the past year. From January 5th, 2024, Epoch 459, through December 30th, Epoch 531, the actual total income into the Cardano Treasury was 335,957,093 ada. So this NCL essentially states that we will not spend more than what we made last year. I think that’s a pretty reasonable statement.\n\n- Just as easily as we are having a vote now, we can vote to revise the NCL in 2026. I would expect that the DReps will vote to adjust the NCL appropriately over time to ensure sustainable deployment of the Cardano Treasury. \n\n- There is a balance between ‘spending and being wasteful’ versus ‘not spending and constraining the ecosystem.’ This NCL puts a reasonable guardrail on those discussions."

          "text": "我投票反对将净变化限额 (NCL) 降至2亿 ADA，这是迄今为止最艰难的治理决策之一。\n\n感觉这里似乎没有完全好的选择。\n\n而且，我自己也曾呼吁降低 NCL。\n\n目前3.5亿 ADA 的 NCL 存在一些显著的缺点。\n\n如果巨大的抛售压力导致 ADA 价格大幅下跌，比如说跌至0.2美元，则可能导致严重挑战。\n\n以美元计价资助生态系统将需要从财政库出售大量 ADA，从而导致抛售压力的螺旋式上升，使情况恶化。\n\nCardano Whale (@cardano_whale) 指出，像 Tezos 和 Polkadot 这样的一些项目在其生态系统中投入了大量资金，拥有创新技术，但仍难以获得实质性关注。\n\n我完全同意这一点。\n\n对于区块链而言，保持在市值排名前十的位置至关重要。\n\n散户投资者、机构和加密货币爱好者不仅根据技术，还根据市场表现来评估项目。\n\n如果 Cardano 长期跌出前十，无论其去中心化程度或像 Ouroboros Leios 这样的技术进步如何，它可能永远无法恢复其地位。\n\n这是一个需要考虑的重要因素，即使感觉不公平或主观。\n\n另一方面，将 NCL 降至2亿 ADA 也带来了一系列担忧。\n\nCardano 需要投资来推进其技术，支持建设者，并发展生态系统。如果没有增加的用户活动，财政库收入将无法增长。\n\n未来几年在维护和开发上的支出可能会耗尽储备金，最终使 Cardano 在经济上不可持续。\n\n协议安全性也取决于有吸引力的权益奖励和激励措施。此外，如果没有活跃的开发者、工具和不断发展的 DeFi 生态系统，Ouroboros Leios 的潜力将无法发挥。所有这些领域的投资都至关重要。\n\nIOG 已经明确了他们的资金需求：核心开发需要9600万 ADA，Catalyst 需要6900万 ADA，研究需要2700万 ADA。总计1.92亿 ADA。IOG 的提议很简单：要么批准这笔资金，要么就此作罢。\n\n关于公平性、IOG 和 Charles 过去的贡献以及 Cardano“完成”定义的辩论有其道理，但现实是 IOG 在协议方面拥有无与伦比的专业知识。没有其他实体能够以相同的速度或质量有效地接管维护、开发和研究。\n\n如果 DReps 将1.92亿 ADA 分配给 IOG，那么其他项目只剩下800万 ADA。\n\n在审查了预算提案后，我只支持了我认为生态系统绝对需要的基本项目：像 Midgard、Starstream、Hydra、ZK Rollups、Blockfrost、Lucid、Chainlink 集成等项目。\n\n仅 CORE 类别一项，就大约需要1200万 ADA。在所有类别中，我批准的总预算达到2.13亿 ADA。\n\n鉴于我自己估计所需支出为2.13亿 ADA，我不能支持2亿 ADA 的 NCL。\n\n这将与我在必要项目资金和我批准的上限方面的立场相矛盾。这种不一致性引导我投票反对降低 NCL。\n\nCardano 需要有效的营销和改进的治理支持，因为目前的情况远非理想。\n\n投资生态系统和推进新技术必须齐头并进，以确保可持续增长。\n\n在我看来，批准2亿 ADA 的 NCL 意味着维持现状，将所有关键职责留给 IOG，同时忽视对更广泛生态系统的投资。\n\n从本质上讲，这将限制对与 IOG 一样对生态系统至关重要的实体的资助。\n\n关于 NCL 的预期情景是一个重要的考虑因素。\n\n在我看来，3.5亿 ADA 和2亿 ADA 的 NCL 都是极端的。\n\n目前的 NCL 定为3.5亿 ADA，得到了76%的投票权益的强烈支持。几乎所有的投票权益都批准了它。将 NCL 从3.5亿大幅降低到2亿 ADA，要么是不负责任的，要么是过于雄心勃勃的。\n\n接下来会发生什么？建设者、Intersect、IOG 或其他人可能会提交一项新的治理行动，提议一个中间的 NCL，可能是2.5亿或3亿 ADA。或者，可能会同时提交多个提案。\n\n这种情况会造成一个不稳定的环境，这是适得其反且难以支持的。这种不稳定性会破坏进展。\n\n此外，加密社区对 Cardano 生态系统能负担多少投资的冗长辩论兴趣不大。\n\n在不稳定的环境中，即使提出一个连贯的预算也几乎是不可能的。\n\n目前，我们的 NCL 是3.5亿 ADA。考虑一下这个可能的情景：\n\nIntersect 预计将提交一项针对6月份到期预算的治理行动。与此同时，如果5月底批准了新的2亿 ADA NCL，那么除非在新的 NCL 生效前获得批准，否则提议的预算实际上将变得违宪。\n\n这使得过程复杂化，并进一步凸显了突然、极端变化带来的问题。\n\n通过治理行动来辩论 NCL 既低效又耗时。\n\n社区的共识似乎很可能在2.5亿至3亿 ADA 之间。然而，在链上投票之前，没有进行过（大多数社区会回应的）链下温度测试，这导致了目前的 NCL 仅仅为了让预算过程继续下去而被批准。\n\nNCL 的概念本身开始让人觉得没有必要，因为它总是根据多数票而变化。如果投票权益同意增加或减少 NCL，这不可避免地会发生。\n\n重要的是要强调，NCL 并不决定必须从财政库中支出的金额。每一项提款提案仍然需要社区的批准。\n\n如果目前的提案在2.5亿至3亿 ADA 的范围内，我可能会投赞成票。如果提交了这样的提案，我会支持它，因为它符合我认为基于我已认可的提案的合理预算。\n\n然而，我的决定并非最终决定，可能会根据未来治理方面的发展而改变。\n\n例如，如果治理行动将多个提案合并导致总成本过高，或者如果 IOG 提案与我不支持的几个提案或我强烈反对的一个提案（例如 Daedalus 2025 服务增强）组合在一起，我可能会重新考虑我的立场。\n\n如果防止不良预算结果的唯一方法是投票支持较低的 NCL，我准备这样做。这个决定是微妙的，不能非黑即白地看待。\n\n我希望避免出现批准较低 NCL 不可避免地导致再次提交 GA 的情况。反复处理 NCL 既耗时又没有成效。\n\nDReps 需要优先考虑预算提案。\n\n如果一个较高的 NCL 最终资助了预算内质量低劣的项目，那么它就毫无意义。\n\n我的 DRep ID：\ndrep1km69g7ksf8t5g0h9d9tkrcd2tezxelx0wtr76rv2mrkl5nzd6v3",

          "originalText": "I voted NO ⛔️to reduce the Net Change Limit (NCL) to 200M ADA, which has been one of the toughest governance decisions so far. \n\nIt feels like there’s no entirely good option here.\n\nMoreover, I myself called for a lower NCL.\n\nThe current NCL of 350M ADA has some notable drawbacks.\n\nIf high selling pressure causes ADA’s price to drop significantly, say to 0.2 USD, it could result in serious challenges. \n\nFunding the ecosystem in dollar terms would require selling a large amount of ADA from the treasury, leading to a spiral of selling pressure that could worsen the situation.\n\nCardano Whale (@cardano_whale) pointed out that some projects like Tezos and Polkadot have invested heavily in their ecosystems, possess innovative technologies, yet struggle to gain substantial attention.\n\nI fully agree with that.\n\nFor blockchains, maintaining a presence in the top 10 market capitalization rankings is vital.\n\nRetail investors, institutions, and crypto enthusiasts evaluate projects not only based on technology but also on market performance. \n\nIf Cardano drops out of the top 10 for an extended period, it may never regain its position, regardless of decentralization or technological progress like Ouroboros Leios. \n\nThis is an important factor to consider, even if it feels unfair or subjective.\n\nOn the other hand, reducing the NCL to 200M ADA comes with its own set of concerns.\n\nCardano needs investments to advance its technology, support builders, and develop the ecosystem. Without increased user activity, Treasury revenue won't grow. \n\nSpending on maintenance and development in the next years risks exhausting the reserve, ultimately making Cardano economically unsustainable.\n\nProtocol security also hinges on attractive staking rewards and incentives. Moreover, Ouroboros Leios’s potential will remain untapped without active developers, tools, and a growing DeFi ecosystem. Investments in all these areas are crucial.\n\nIOG has made their funding requirements clear: Core Dev needs 96M ADA, Catalyst 69M ADA, and Research 27M ADA. Combined, this totals 192M ADA. The offer from IOG is simple: either approve this funding or let it be.\n\nDebates around fairness, IOG and Charles’s past contributions, and the definition of “completion” for Cardano have their place, but the reality is that IOG holds unmatched expertise in the protocol. No other entity can effectively take over maintenance, development, and research at the same pace or quality.\n\nIf DReps allocate 192M ADA to IOG, only 8M ADA remains for other projects.\n\nAfter reviewing budget proposals, I supported only the essentials I believe the ecosystem absolutely needs: projects like Midgard, Starstream, Hydra, ZK Rollups, Blockfrost, Lucid, Chainlink integration, and others. \n\nFor the CORE category alone, this amounts to around 12M ADA. Across all categories, my total approved budget comes to 213M ADA.\n\nGiven my own estimate of required expenditures is 213M ADA, I cannot support an NCL of 200M ADA. \n\nIt would contradict my stance on necessary project funding versus the cap I approve. This inconsistency guided my decision to vote NO on reducing the NCL.\n\nCardano requires effective marketing and improved governance support, as the current situation is far from ideal.\n\nInvesting in the ecosystem and advancing new technologies must go hand in hand to ensure sustainable growth.\n\nApproving the NCL of 200M ADA, in my view, would mean preserving the status quo, leaving all key responsibilities to IOG while neglecting investment in the broader ecosystem. \n\nEssentially, it would restrict funding for entities that are vital to the ecosystem, just as IOG is.\n\nAn important consideration is the expected scenarios surrounding the NCL.\n\nBoth NCLs, an NCL of 350M ADA and 200M ADA, are extremes in my view.\n\nThe current NCL, set at 350M ADA, has strong support with 76% of the voting stake participating. Nearly the entire voting stake approved it. Drastically reducing the NCL from 350M to 200M ADA would be either irresponsible or overly ambitious.\n\nWhat would happen next? Builders, Intersect, IOG, or others would likely submit a new governance action proposing an intermediate NCL, perhaps 250M or 300M ADA. Alternatively, multiple proposals could be submitted simultaneously.\n\nThis scenario would create an unstable environment that is counterproductive and difficult to support. Such instability undermines progress.\n\nMoreover, the crypto community has little interest in prolonged debates about how much the Cardano ecosystem can afford to invest.\n\nIn an unstable environment, even proposing a coherent budget becomes nearly impossible.\n\nCurrently, we have an NCL of 350M ADA. Consider this likely scenario:\n\nIntersect is expected to submit a governance action for the budget expiring in June. Meanwhile, if a new NCL of 200M ADA is approved by the end of May, the proposed budget would effectively become unconstitutional unless it is approved before the new NCL takes effect. \n\nThis complicates the process and further highlights the issues with sudden, extreme changes.\n\nDebating the NCL through governance actions is both inefficient and overly time-consuming.\n\nIt seems likely that the community's consensus would fall somewhere between 250M–300M ADA. However, no off-chain temperature check was conducted (to which the majority of the community would respond) before the on-chain vote, which led to the current NCL being approved simply to allow the budgeting process to continue.\n\nThe concept of the NCL itself is starting to feel unnecessary, as it constantly shifts based on the majority vote. If the voting stake agrees to increase or decrease the NCL, it will inevitably happen.\n\nIt’s important to emphasize that the NCL doesn’t dictate the amount that must be spent from the treasury. Every withdrawal proposal still requires approval from the community.\n\nI would likely vote YES if the current proposal fell within the 250M–300M ADA range. If a proposal like this is submitted, I would support it, as it aligns with the budget I consider reasonable based on the proposals I have endorsed.\n\nHowever, my decision isn’t final and may change depending on future developments in governance. \n\nFor instance, if governance actions combine multiple proposals that result in an excessively high total cost, or if the IOG proposal is grouped with several proposals I don’t support, or one I strongly oppose, such as the Daedalus 2025 Service Enhancement, I might reconsider my stance.\n\nIf the only way to prevent a poor budget outcome is to vote for a lower NCL, I am prepared to do so. This decision is nuanced and cannot be seen in black-and-white terms.\n\nI want to avoid a scenario where approving a lower NCL inevitably results in another GA submission. Addressing the NCL repeatedly is time-consuming and unproductive. \n\nDReps need to prioritize budget proposals instead.\n\nA higher NCL serves no purpose if it ends up funding low-quality projects within the budget.\n\nMy DRep ID:\ndrep1km69g7ksf8t5g0h9d9tkrcd2tezxelx0wtr76rv2mrkl5nzd6v3"

Setting the NCL at 200M ADA would nearly exhaust the limit, leaving little room for funding other critical infrastructure proposals. This situation risks hindering Cardano’s growth.\n\nFundamentally, the NCL is not a budget intended to be fully spent, but rather a guardrail that defines the maximum amount that may be withdrawn within a given period. As we are still in the early stages of transitioning to on-chain governance, imposing a restrictive cap at this time could undermine the flexibility needed for effective decision-making and timely response.\n\nMoreover, the NCL is not fixed permanently once established. It should be subject to review and adjustment as budget execution progresses and as market conditions evolve.\n\nIn this transitional period, it is prudent to design with sufficient margin to accommodate uncertainty. Doing so will support sustainable and strategic ecosystem governance.\n\n#Cardano #ADA #Drep"

          "originalText": "As Cardano’s 2025 budget process gains momentum, multiple proposals have emerged to reassess the Net Change Limit (NCL). Here’s a breakdown of the current situation:\n\n✅ Approved: The 2025 NCL of 350M ADA has been formally ratified by DReps. It’s based on a 2024 treasury income model (approx. 336M ADA) and now serves as the foundation for current budget deliberations.\n\n❌ Rejected: A more conservative proposal to cap 2025 at 300M ADA and 2026 at 250M ADA was not approved.\n\n🟠 Under Review:\n“2025 Cardano NCL” proposes lowering the NCL to 200M ADA, urging a cautious approach during this first year of decentralized treasury governance.\n“300M ADA for Epochs 563–635” aims to establish an NCL for early 2026, supporting budget continuity across overlapping periods.\n\nMeanwhile, several new funding proposals have been submitted:\n\n1⃣ 7.5M ADA for Community Builder Proposals — includes only those with ≥2.69B ADA support, excluding proposals from Intersect and founding entities.\n\n2⃣ 1.5M ADA for Amaru Rust Node Development — a PRAGMA-led initiative to diversify Cardano nodes and enhance network resilience.\n\n3⃣ 50M ADA for DeFi Liquidity — aims to seed liquidity into DEXs and stablecoins, with yield partially returned to the treasury.\n\nAs SIPO DRep, we’re evaluating these developments based on:\n\n🔍 Cautious governance: supports the 200M ADA NCL.\n🚀 Growth & momentum: supports maintaining the 350M ADA cap.\n⚖️ Balanced compromise: 300M ADA could be a pragmatic middle ground.\n\nFor funding proposals, our assessment will focus on:\nDoes it generate a return to the treasury?\nIs transparency and execution capacity ensured?\nDoes it set a strong precedent for the first year of decentralized financial governance?\n\nThe NCL is more than just a number — it reflects Cardano’s financial philosophy and growth trajectory. Changing the cap directly impacts which proposals are viable.\n\nWe’ll soon publish SIPO’s evaluation criteria and vote logic for each major proposal. In the meantime, we welcome your input before the voting begins.\n\nIf you support our work as a DRep, please consider delegating:\n\nDRep ID:\ndrep1yffld2866p00cyg3ejjdewtvazgah7jjgk0s9m7m5ytmmdq33v3zh\n\nFor Daedalus:\ndrep120m237kstm7pzywv5nwtjm8gj8dl55j9nupwlkapz77mgv7zu7l"

      "abstract": "谨代表 Intersect 和 Cardano Budget Committee，本预算信息行动提议一项总额为 275,269,340 ada 的 Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Budget。本预算信息行动的有效期将自投票期结束时开始，并持续 73 epochs（52周）。该预算为总和拨款，后续的国库提款必须符合已批准且有效的 Net Change Limit 及其他条件。该预算包含39项提案，支持 Cardano 区块链生态系统内的维护、开发、营销、创新和治理计划。\n\n为达成此预算，Intersect 推动了社区预算提交流程，通过 Ekklesia 平台使用实时 DRep 权益来评估和验证支持情况。超过 38亿 ada 的投票权益参与其中，占活跃委托权益的70%以上（不包括预定义投票选项）。作为 Intersect 预算推广协调工作的一部分，共提交了194项提案。获得参与 DRep 超过50%权益支持并指定 Intersect 为其管理人的项目已包含在本预算信息行动中。提交的194项提案中，有40项达到了所需的支持阈值，其中39项指定 Intersect 为其管理人。任何在本预算信息行动之外直接链上进行的提案均已从我们的预算中排除。\n\n下述所有提案均请求 Intersect 作为其管理人，Intersect 将根据本预算及 Cardano Constitution 的要求，监督和管理从 Cardano Blockchain Treasury 提取资金的使用。这包括根据 Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Constitution 第四条第2款利用区块链技术（例如智能合约）。作为此总和预算中所含提案的管理人，Intersect 将在可能和可用的情况下，利用智能合约框架监督资金支付，包括一个由组织和审计方组成的多重签名监督机构，Intersect 作为管理人将是其中之一。",
      "content": "本理由支持 Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem 预算信息行动——一项总额为 275,269,340 ada 的拨款，分配给39项提案，每项提案均获得了超过50%参与 DRep 权益的支持（38亿 ada 的实时权益，占活跃委托权益的70%以上，不包括预定义投票选项）。\n\n**提案接收与整合**\n\n在2025年4月1日  – 5月5日期间，Intersect 的 Cardano Budget Committee 通过两个渠道接受资金申请：\n\n- 与 Intersect 多个委员会（产品、开源、治理、营销、研究）相关的委员会“整笔预算”，与愿景和产品路线图保持一致。\n- 来自任何 Cardano贡献者的开放式社区提交，无论其是否为 Intersect 成员。\n\n所有194份提交都遵循标准模板（问题、益处、路线图一致性、成本），并可通过委员会反馈进行完善，在 DRep 审查前同时涵盖自上而下的战略和自下而上的创新。\n\n**社区信号**\n\nDRep 和 ada 持有者通过两轮链下投票表达了他们的偏好：一次初步的 GovTool 调查和一次最终的 Ekklesia“意向摸底”投票（截止时间为2025年5月5日23:59 UTC）。获得超过50%参与 DRep 权益支持并选择 Intersect 作为其管理人的提案进入了本预算信息行动。投票产出物已公开（见下文参考资料）。所有提案内容在“意向摸底”投票结束时均已打上时间戳，并作为本次链上提交的一部分发布到 IPFS，从而创建了不可篡改的记录。\n\n**链上批准与监督**\n\n**预算信息行动与 Net Change Limit**\n\n这39项符合资格的提案已被捆绑到此单一预算信息行动中，供 DRep 批准。截至2025年5月8日，虽然请求的总资金低于当前生效的 Net Change Limit (NCL)——350万亿 lovelace（即3.5亿 ada），但 NCL 本身可随时通过单独的信息行动进行修订。因此，每次后续的国库提款都必须在符合届时有效的 NCL 的情况下提交并获得批准，这符合 Cardano Constitution 第四条和 Guardrail: TREASURY-02a 的规定。\n\n尽管所有入选提案均已请求 Intersect 作为其管理人，但此指定并非自动保证。在任何国库提款治理行动之前，提案人将被要求接受尽职调查，包括 KYC/KYB 及其他背景和验证检查。如果提案未能满足这些要求，Intersect 保留拒绝或撤回其管理人角色的权利，并自行酌情决定。\n\n**国库提款与资金管理**\n\n一旦获得批准，Intersect——在此预算拨款所含的每项提案中均被指定为管理人——将提交国库提款治理行动，供 DRep 批准从 Cardano Treasury 发放资金。保障措施包括：\n\n- 在可能且适用的情况下，使用由 Intersect、独立审计方和其他指定机构签署的多重签名控制的智能合约去中心化托管。该功能正由 Sundae Labs 开发。\n- 从智能合约或相关账户的资金支付将按照提案的合同条款执行，并接受定期监督、报告以及（如适用）里程碑验收。这些信息将通过新的社区仪表板公开。\n- 审计和暂停支付功能允许在违反合同条款时暂停资金。仲裁后，智能合约或相关账户中任何未支付的剩余资金将被退回 Cardano Treasury。\n- 链上透明度：每笔付款均可公开追溯，Intersect 的交付保障团队将与当选委员会合作发布进展报告，供社区监督。\n\n**成果**\n\n通过社区信号、DRep 批准、适应性的 NCL 合规以及智能合约监督（在适用和可用的情况下），Cardano 可以充满信心地为2025年路线图及支持性举措提供资金——负责任地分配国库资源，同时保持适应未来经济参数的灵活性。\n\nCardano Constitution 中规定的条款声明，Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem 预算的批准需要超过50%的活跃投票 DRep 权益的阈值，并且 Constitutional Committee 成员应在链上记录投票，阐明其对拟议预算（如果按“信息”行动中所含形式实施）是否会违反本 Constitution 的意见。因此，本预算信息行动将在 DRep 投票达到或超过 50% +1 lovelace，且 Constitutional Committee （7名成员中的至少5名）投票认定该预算不违反本 Constitution 的情况下，被视为通过。",

          "abstract": "On behalf of Intersect and the Cardano Budget Committee, this Budget Info Action proposes a Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Budget of 275,269,340 ada. The period during which this Budget Info Action remains in effect will begin at the close of its voting period and continue for 73 epochs (52 weeks). This budget is an aggregate allocation and following Treasury Withdrawal(s) must be in compliance with an approved and active Net Change Limit, among other conditions. This budget comprises 39 proposals that support maintenance, development, marketing, innovation, and governance initiatives within the Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem.\n\nTo arrive at this budget, Intersect facilitated a community budget submission process, using live DRep stake to assess and validate support through the Ekklesia platform. More than 3.8B ada in voting stake participated, representing over 70% of actively delegated stake (excluding pre-defined voting options). A total of 194 proposals were submitted as part of Intersect’s coordination efforts for budget socialization. Projects that received over 50% support by stake from participating DReps, and named Intersect as their Administrator, have been included in this Budget Info Action. Of the 194 proposals submitted, 40 met the required support threshold, and 39 of these named Intersect as their Administrator. Any proposals that proceeded directly on-chain outside of this Budget Info Action have been excluded from ours.\n\nAll proposals listed below have requested Intersect as their Administrator, who will oversee and administer the use of funds from Cardano Blockchain Treasury withdrawals in accordance with this budget and the requirements of the Cardano Constitution. This includes leveraging blockchain technology such as smart contracts as per Article IV, Section 2 in the Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Constitution. Intersect, in our role as an Administrator for the included proposals in this aggregate budget, will - wherever possible and available - utilize a smart contract framework to oversee disbursements including a multi-signature oversight body made up of organizations and auditors, one of which will be Intersect in our role as Administrator.",
          "rationale": "This rationale underpins the Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Budget Info Action - an aggregate allocation of 275,269,340 ada across 39 proposals that each won >50% of participating DRep stake (3.8B ada in live stake >70% of actively delegated stake excluding pre-defined voting options).\n\n**Proposal Intake & Consolidation**\n\nBetween 1 April  – 5 May 2025, the Cardano Budget Committee at Intersect accepted funding requests through two streams:\n\n- Committee “block budgets” connected to several Intersect committees (product, open source, governance, marketing, research) aligned to the vision and product roadmap.\n- Open community submissions from any Cardano contributor, regardless of Intersect membership.\n\nAll 194 submissions followed a standard template (problem, benefits, roadmap alignment, cost) and could be refined with committee feedback, capturing both top-down strategy and bottom-up innovation before DRep review.\n\n**Community Signalling**\n\nDReps and ada holders expressed their preferences in two rounds of off-chain polling: an initial GovTool survey and a final Ekklesia “temperature-check” poll that closed at 23:59 UTC on 5 May 2025. Proposals that garnered over 50% of the participating DRep stake and selected Intersect as their Administrator advanced to this Budget Info Action. The poll artefacts are publicly available (see references below). All proposal content was timestamped at the close of the temperature-check poll and now published to IPFS as part of this on-chain submission, creating an immutable record.\n\n**On-Chain Approval & Oversight**\n\n**Budget Info Action & Net Change Limit**\n\nThe 39 qualifying proposals have been bundled into this single Budget Info Action for DRep ratification. While the total requested funding sits below the Net Change Limit (NCL) currently in force, 350 trillion lovelace, or 350 million ada, as of 8 May 2025, the NCL itself can be amended by a separate Info Action at any time. Consequently, each subsequent Treasury Withdrawal must be presented and approved only if it remains within the then-active NCL, in line with Article IV of the Cardano Constitution and Guardrail: TREASURY-02a.\n\nAlthough all included proposals have requested Intersect as their Administrator, this designation is not automatically guaranteed. Ahead of any Treasury Withdrawal governance action, proposers will be required to undergo due diligence, including KYC/KYB and other background and verification checks. Intersect reserves the right to decline or withdraw its role as Administrator if a proposal fails to meet these requirements, and remains at its discretion.\n\n**Treasury Withdrawal & Fund Management**\n\nOnce ratified, Intersect - named as the Administrator in every proposal included in this budget allocation - will submit Treasury Withdrawal governance action(s) for DReps to approve the release of funds from the Cardano Treasury. Safeguards include:\n\n- Wherever possible and applicable, multi-sig controlled smart-contract decentralized escrow with signers from Intersect, independent auditors, and other appointed bodies. Being developed by Sundae Labs.\n- Disbursements from smart contracts or related accounts will be executed in line with the proposal’s contractual terms and subject to regular oversight, reporting, and - where applicable - milestone acceptance. These will be public via a new community dashboard.\n- Audit and pause-payment capability allow funds to be paused if contractual terms are breached. After arbitration, any undisbursed funds remaining in the smart contract or related accounts will be returned to the Cardano Treasury.\n- On-chain transparency: every payment is publicly traceable, and Intersect’s delivery assurance team working with elected committees will publish progress reports for community oversight.\n\n**Outcome**\n\nThrough community signalling, DRep ratification, adaptable NCL compliance, and smart-contract oversight (wherever applicable and available), Cardano can fund the 2025 roadmap and supporting initiatives confidently - allocating Treasury resources responsibly while retaining the agility to adapt to future economic parameters.\n\nThe provisions set forth in the Cardano Constitution state that the approval of a Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem budget requires a threshold of greater than 50% of the active voting DRep stake and that Constitutional Committee members shall record a vote on-chain that sets forth their opinion as to whether the proposed budget, if it were to be implemented in the form contained in the “Info” action, would violate this Constitution. Therefore, this Budget Info Action will be considered passed with a DRep vote of greater than or equal to 50% +1 lovelace and a Constitutional Committee vote of at least 5 of 7 members.",
          "motivation": "On March 30, the Cardano community approved the “Defining the Cardano Vision and Roadmap for 2025 and Beyond” Info Action, establishing the foundations for building and anchoring a budget to support its delivery. The budget socialization process - facilitated by Intersect in collaboration with the Cardano community and DRep participation - was designed to be inclusive, with no formal criteria required to take part. It supports the ongoing operation, maintenance, and future development of the Cardano blockchain ecosystem and implementation, administration and maintenance of the decentralized, on-chain governance processes  (as outlined in Article IV, Section 1).\n\nThis budget represents an aggregate allocation from the Cardano Treasury covering a multi-period timeframe, as defined in the individual proposals included herein. The total amount of ada withdrawn from the Treasury is subject to due diligence requirements in Intersect’s role as an Administrator - including KYC/KYB and sanctions compliance - the satisfaction of contractually negotiated milestones and terms, and remaining within an approved and active Net Change Limit.

Intersect reserves the right to decline or withdraw its role as Administrator if a proposal fails to meet these requirements, and remains at its discretion.\n\n**Treasury Withdrawal & Fund Management**\n\nOnce ratified, Intersect - named as the Administrator in every proposal included in this budget allocation - will submit Treasury Withdrawal governance action(s) for DReps to approve the release of funds from the Cardano Treasury. Safeguards include:\n\n- Wherever possible and applicable, multi-sig controlled smart-contract decentralized escrow with signers from Intersect, independent auditors, and other appointed bodies. Being developed by Sundae Labs.\n- Disbursements from smart contracts or related accounts will be executed in line with the proposal’s contractual terms and subject to regular oversight, reporting, and - where applicable - milestone acceptance. These will be public via a new community dashboard.\n- Audit and pause-payment capability allow funds to be paused if contractual terms are breached. After arbitration, any undisbursed funds remaining in the smart contract or related accounts will be returned to the Cardano Treasury.\n- On-chain transparency: every payment is publicly traceable, and Intersect’s delivery assurance team working with elected committees will publish progress reports for community oversight.\n\n**Outcome**\n\nThrough community signalling, DRep ratification, adaptable NCL compliance, and smart-contract oversight (wherever applicable and available), Cardano can fund the 2025 roadmap and supporting initiatives confidently - allocating Treasury resources responsibly while retaining the agility to adapt to future economic parameters.\n\nThe provisions set forth in the Cardano Constitution state that the approval of a Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem budget requires a threshold of greater than 50% of the active voting DRep stake and that Constitutional Committee members shall record a vote on-chain that sets forth their opinion as to whether the proposed budget, if it were to be implemented in the form contained in the “Info” action, would violate this Constitution. Therefore, this Budget Info Action will be considered passed with a DRep vote of greater than or equal to 50% +1 lovelace and a Constitutional Committee vote of at least 5 of 7 members.",

        "motivation": "On March 30, the Cardano community approved the “Defining the Cardano Vision and Roadmap for 2025 and Beyond” Info Action, establishing the foundations for building and anchoring a budget to support its delivery. The budget socialization process - facilitated by Intersect in collaboration with the Cardano community and DRep participation - was designed to be inclusive, with no formal criteria required to take part. It supports the ongoing operation, maintenance, and future development of the Cardano blockchain ecosystem and implementation, administration and maintenance of the decentralized, on-chain governance processes  (as outlined in Article IV, Section 1).\n\nThis budget represents an aggregate allocation from the Cardano Treasury covering a multi-period timeframe, as defined in the individual proposals included herein. The total amount of ada withdrawn from the Treasury is subject to due diligence requirements in Intersect’s role as an Administrator - including KYC/KYB and sanctions compliance - the satisfaction of contractually negotiated milestones and terms, and remaining within an approved and active Net Change Limit.

        "myOpinion": "考虑到Cardano推进其技术基础设施（Hydra、Leios、Layer 2解决方案）并培育一个繁荣、有竞争力的生态系统的战略必要性，一项大规模、协调的资助计划无疑是必需的。该提案旨在通过实施社区对39个项目的信号偏好来解决这个问题，并由Intersect履行宪法规定的管理职责。\n\n然而，拟议的机制——对39个不同提案进行一次性的、捆绑式的2.75亿ADA投票——带来了严重的治理和战略风险。这种“全有或全无”的方法严重限制了DRep的精细监督，可能导致将较低优先级的项目与关键项目一同资助，从而妨碍了有效的资本配置。当Cardano的战略强调需要“为优秀工程进行投资”并专注于核心技术进步时，这一点尤其令人担忧。社区就DRep咨询、投票透明度和Ekklesia流程中的门槛计算所提出的程序性担忧，也削弱了这一聚合行动的合法性。\n\n虽然不实施这一特定的捆绑提案可能会导致资金的短期延迟，但它提供了一个关键的机会来改进流程，以实现更大的DRep赋权、透明度和战略一致性。错误分配如此巨额资金的潜在负面影响——包括ADA贬值和损害社区信任——超过了在这种情况下追求权宜之计的好处。\n\n因此，我**反对**当前这种捆绑形式的提案。\n\n我的理由基于以下原则：\n1.  **战略一致性与效率**：对39个不同提案进行捆绑投票，难以确保资金主要用于Cardano的核心技术目标，如Leios、Hydra和L2扩容解决方案。更精细的方法将有助于更好地实现一致性，并确保资源集中在能够产生最高长期战略价值的领域。\n2.  **DRep问责制与精细监督**：捆绑方法削弱了DReps对个别提案做出明智判断的能力，而这对于健全的去中心化治理至关重要。\n3.  **透明度与合法性**：社区强调的程序模糊性和DRep咨询缺乏的问题必须得到解决，以确保Cardano治理流程的长期健康和合法性。\n4.  **长期可持续性**：虽然眼前的资金很重要，但建立健全、透明和负责任的融资机制对于Cardano的战略可持续性更为关键。为此类巨额资金接受一个有缺陷的流程会开创一个不良先例。\n\n更可取的做法是，将提案分解为更小、主题更连贯的组合包，或允许对单个提案进行批准，同时明确解决程序上的担忧。这将促进更广泛的DRep参与，确保更有针对性的资金与Cardano的战略技术重点保持一致，并在治理体系中建立更强大的社区信任，即使这最初可能需要更多时间。"

          "text": "关于Cardano预算的一些观察。\n\n我对2.667亿ADA的总预算感到满意。我预计收入会更高（约3.2亿ADA），所以我们很可能在未来几年节省下ADA。\n\n处于牛市有几个原因让我们有理由增加投资。\n\n随着ADA市场价格的上涨，用较少数量的ADA币获得更高的美元价值成为可能。\n\n此外，明智的投资可以吸引新用户加入生态系统。预计用户活跃度将在2026年中期下降。\n\n为接下来三个Catalyst基金（每个基金2000万ADA）仅拨款6000万ADA的可能原因是ADA的市场价格较高。\n\n我发现预算中缺失的是对DeFi的投资和稳定币的铸造。\n\n我设想每个epoch铸造100-200万稳定币，例如USDM和DJED。如果整个牛市期间ADA的平均价格为1美元，成本将在1.4亿美元左右，这大约相当于1.4亿ADA。\n\n然而，如果ADA的平均价格更高，比如2美元，那么ADA价值的成本将减半。\n\n预算计算1 ADA等于0.5美元。这在我看来是不够的。\n\n这是一个我们应该讨论和考虑的话题。\n\n目前的预算可以减少吗？我们可以不同地分配ADA吗？\n\n我不想在不了解所有细节的情况下逐条批评高昂的成本。我将凭常识判断。\n\n欢迎随时纠正我或提供重要背景信息。\n\n链上治理对我来说似乎过于昂贵。虽然DReps可以对治理行动进行投票，但Intersect和各种委员会将花费我们数千万的ADA。\n\n如此高的预算，我们有可能在下一个熊市期间耗尽金库中的大量ADA。\n\n预算委员会的成本似乎也很高。有些流程可以更具成本效益。我们真的需要预算峰会吗？DReps可以在Cardano峰会上开会（见下文）。\n\n为IntersectMBO拨款2000万ADA似乎很多。\n\n当我查看单个项目时，总额是270万ADA。也许我理解错了什么。\n\n关于产品委员会类别，成本显得很高，特别是对于我们可能不需要或我认为已经准备好的项目。\n\n如果我没记错的话，多资源共识Minotaur是为Midnight而不是Cardano构建的。Proof of Useful Work也是如此。\n\n我想主要关注可扩展性、ZK技术、L2s以及Cardano尽快需要的其他技术。预算中的一些项目可以等等。\n\n我希望看到一个与路线图相关联的预算。我们首先需要战略。然后制定路线图并将其与预算联系起来。\n\n预算中最大的成本与Technical Steering Committee有关。核心维护将花费我们4000万ADA。这似乎是一笔巨大的开支，值得更详细地调查。\n\n在分配给Membership & Community Committee的8000万ADA中，6000万ADA用于三个Catalyst基金。这给我们留下了2000万ADA来讨论。\n\n我从未听说过Community Hubs。我知道有人提议在Catalyst中创建各种中心，有些也获得了资助。我们真的需要为Community Hub投资320万ADA吗？\n\n1120万ADA分配给The Civic Committee。这包括委员会成员和DReps的报酬。\n\n180万ADA分配给DReps，约占总预算的0.5%。虽然普遍的看法是DReps应该免费工作，但我认为使用预算的0.5%作为他们的奖励是合理的。DReps和委员会成员应该得到一些补偿。\n\nDReps决定预算。他们可以节省ADA或更好地指导预算。\n\n一个值得讨论的话题是DReps是否应该更多地参与内部流程。DReps由社区选举产生，如果他们有兴趣，他们应该成为委员会成员并参与诸如编制预算之类的任务。\n\n也许只有那些更多参与这些流程的DReps才应该获得报酬。\n\n我会将分配给Growth & Marketing Committee的2000万ADA减半。Cardano需要投资于技术，而不是营销。我或多或少同意增长部分的项目。\n\nCardano Summit 2026的成本是310万ADA。我同意这一点，并将其直接与其他会议联系起来，例如DReps会议和关于下一个预算的辩论。\n\n我绝对不会付钱给网红。我不相信这种营销方式有效。\n\n我批准为Open Source Committee拨款380万ADA，并且如果能在其他地方节省资金，我很乐意增加预算。\n\n尽管我对预算有所保留，并努力削减了一些成本，但我可能愿意批准该预算。我还不确定。我希望看到一些变化。\n\n预算仍将根据社区的意见进行更改，因此请在Cardano Forum上发表评论。\n\n我的意见是，我们应该在营销上节省开支，也许在Community Hubs上，在Cardano未来两年不需要的技术开发上，以及其他项目上，而是应该铸造稳定币。\n\n每个人对预算都会有不同的看法。在去中心化的环境中很难达成共识。因此，除非我发现根本性问题，否则我倾向于批准预算。我将继续审查预算并在需要时发表评论。\n\n我期待最终版本。",

          "originalText": "A few observations about the Cardano budget.\n\nI am pleased with the total budget of 266.7M ADA. I expect revenue to be higher (about 320M ADA), so we will likely save ADA for the next few years.\n\nBeing in a bull market, it is advantageous to invest more for several reasons. \n\nAs the market price of ADA increases, getting a higher dollar value with a smaller amount of ADA coins becomes possible. \n\nAdditionally, smart investments can attract new users to the ecosystem. Let's expect that user activity will decline in the middle of 2026. \n\nThe likely reason for allocating only 60M ADA to the next three Catalyst Funds (20M for each fund) is the higher market price of ADA.\n\nWhat I find missing in the budget are investments in DeFi and the minting of stablecoins. \n\nI envision minting 1-2M stablecoins each epoch, such as USDM and DJED. The cost would be around 140M USD, which translates to about 140M ADA if the average price of ADA throughout the bull market is 1 USD. \n\nHowever, if the average price of ADA were higher, say 2 USD, the cost in the ADA value would be half as much. The budget calculates that 1 ADA is 0.5 USD. That doesn't seem adequate to me.\n\nThis is a topic we should discuss and consider.\n\nCan the current budget be reduced? Can we allocate ADA differently?\n\nI don’t want to criticize the high costs line by line without knowing all the details. I’ll use common sense. \n\nFeel free to correct me or provide important context.\n\nOn-chain governance seems excessively expensive to me. While DReps can vote on governance actions, Intersect and various committees will cost us tens of millions of ADA. \n\nWith such a high budget, we risk depleting a significant amount of ADA in the treasury during the next bear market.\n\nThe costs of the Budget Committee also seem high. Some processes could be more cost-effective. Do we really need a Budget Summit? DReps can meet at the Cardano Summit (see below).\n\nAllocating 20M ADA for IntersectMBO seems like a lot. \n\nWhen I looked at the individual items, the total was 2.7M ADA. Perhaps I am misunderstanding something.\n\nRegarding the Product Committee category, the costs appear high, especially for items that we may not need or that I believe were already ready.\n\nIf I'm not mistaken, the multi-resource consensus Minotaur is being built for Midnight, not Cardano. The same applies to Proof of Useful Work.\n\nI would like to focus primarily on scalability, ZK technology, L2s, and other technologies that Cardano needs as soon as possible. Some items in the budget can wait.\n\nI would like to see a budget linked to the roadmap. We need the strategy first. Then make the roadmap and link it with the budget.\n\nThe largest costs in the budget relate to the Technical Steering Committee. Core Maintenance will cost us 40M ADA. This seems like a huge expense and is worth investigating in more detail.\n\nIn the 80M ADA allocated for the Membership & Community Committee, 60M ADA is for three Catalyst Funds. This leaves us with 20M ADA to discuss. \n\nI have never heard of Community Hubs. I know there were proposals to create various hubs in Catalyst, and some were funded. Do we really need to invest 3.2M ADA in the Community Hub?\n\n11.2M ADA is allocated for The Civic Committee. This includes compensation for committee members and DReps. \n\n1.8M ADA is allocated for DReps, which is roughly 0.5% of the total budget. While the prevailing opinion is that DReps should work for free, I believe using 0.5% of the budget for their rewards is reasonable. DReps and committee members deserve some compensation.\n\nDReps decide on the budget. They can save ADA or better direct the budget.\n\nA topic worth discussing is whether DReps should be more involved in internal processes. DReps are elected by the community, and if they are interested, they should be members of committees and participate in tasks like compiling the budget. \n\nPerhaps only those DReps who are more involved in these processes should be paid.\n\nI would halve the 20M ADA allocated for the Growth & Marketing Committee. Cardano needs to invest in technology, not marketing. I more or less agree with the items in the Growth section.\n\n3.1M ADA is the cost for Cardano Summit 2026. I would agree with that and link it directly to other meetings, such as the DReps meeting and the debate on the next budget.\n\nI would definitely not pay influencers. I don't believe this type of marketing works.\n\nI approve of 3.8M ADA for the Open Source Committee and would gladly increase the budget if possible, provided we save money elsewhere.\n\nDespite my reservations about the budget and my efforts to reduce some costs, I might be willing to approve the budget. I'm not sure yet. I would like to see some changes.\n\nThe budget will still change based on community input, so please comment on the Cardano Forum.\n\nMy opinion is that we should save on marketing, maybe on Community Hubs, development of technologies that Cardano does not need in the next 2 years, and other items and rather mint stablecoins.\n\nEveryone will have a different opinion on the budget. It will be difficult to find consensus in a decentralized environment. Therefore, I will tend to approve the budget unless I find a fundamental problem. I will continue to examine the budget and comment on it if needed.\n\nI am curious about the final version."

          "text": "关于“2025 Net Change Limit”治理信息行动的提前投票意向公告：❌\n\n🚨如果您委托我投票，请重新委托给愿意投赞成票或弃权票的人🚨\n\n我欢迎提议的Net Change Limit提案。提议者表示，从2024年1月5日（Epoch 459）到2024年12月30日（Epoch 531），Cardano财政部的实际总收入为335,957,093 ADA。\n\n提议的NCL为3.5亿ADA。这比Cardano财政部2024年的总收入高出约1400万ADA。我欢迎提案中提到的建模参考以及对我们已有数据的上一时期的参考。\n\n该动议使用上一年度ADA流入模型作为批准NCL的主要依据。这确实是必须考虑的因素之一。\n\n在这个提案中，我所缺失的是——因为它提出了一个相对较大的NCL——即便是对不同NCL的批准会如何影响ADA估值的初步经济分析。3.5亿ADA的NCL正在向市场发出一个信号。这个信号是什么？\n\n它与以前的信号相比如何？如果我们没有数据，至少有预测的空间吗？由于缺乏这种经济/货币分析，我们只能进行猜测。我的感觉是，未来NCL的批准将成为决定ADA兑美元汇率的关键时刻。这是一个信号，表明可以释放多少ADA——一个由大多数DReps批准的信号。\n\n大规模NCL的批准可能会对ADA的价值产生直接的价格影响，从而削弱3.5亿ADA的购买力。在预算项目获得批准之前。\n\n在批准大规模NCL之后，预算讨论可能会在ADA/美元汇率较低的阴影下进行。因此，我们可能被迫将年度预算推向NCL的上限。我们可能会制造一个自我实现的预言。\n\n我认为第一年NCL过大的问题在于，我们的预算和治理流程在第一年是最薄弱和最低效的。我们审计、防止浪费和滥用的能力值得怀疑。较低的NCL会使人集中注意力。\n\n在没有货币/经济分析或预测的情况下，我会考虑在2025年投票支持2-2.5亿ADA的NCL（取决于NCL提案的文本），因为这将向市场发出更好的信号，表明我们打算平衡系统发展和维护ADA价值及Cardano前10名的地位。特别是，由于我们在去中心化治理初期管理如此巨额ADA支出的能力最低。\n\n我认为这种保守的方法能够保护ADA持有者和质押者的利益。\n\n最佳实践：我们应该批准最接近我们DReps实际期望预算的NCL。通过批准一个大得多的NCL，我们将在任何预算获得批准以及承包商收到ADA之前使ADA贬值。这实际上是不必要地削弱了我们自己。\n\n如果像一些（许多？）DReps所表示的那样，意图是批准低于3.5亿ADA的预算，那么为了维护那些将获得ADA的人的ADA价值，我们能做的最好的事情就是投票支持最接近2025年预期预算总额的NCL。",

          "originalText": "Early voting Intention announcement on: \"2025 Net Change Limit\" governance info action: ❌\n\n🚨If you are delegating to me, please redelegate to someone who wants to vote YES or ABSTAIN 🚨\n\nI welcome the proposed Net Change Limit proposal. The proposers have stated that from January 5th, 2024, Epoch 459, through December 30th, Epoch 531, the actual total income into the Cardano Treasury was 335,957,093 ada.\n\nThe proposed NCL is 350M ada. This is roughly 14M ada higher than the total income in the Cardano Treasury for 2024. I welcome the proposed reference to modelling and the reference to a previous period for which we have data. \n\nThe motion uses modelling of ADA inflow for the previous year as the main basis for approving an NCL. It is indeed one of the factors that must be considered.\n \nWhat I am missing in this proposal - as it proposes a relatively large NCL - is even a minor economic analysis of how approvals of different NCLs could impact the valuation of ADA. An NCL of 350M ADA is sending a signal to the market. What is this signal? \n\nHow does it compare to previous signals? If we do not have the data, is there room for a prediction at least?\nWith the lack of this economic/monetary analysis, we are left to speculate. My feeling is that NCL approvals in the future will become defining moments that shape the ADA exchange rate vs the USD. It is a signal how much ADA could be released - a signal approved by the majority of DReps. \n\nThe approval of a large NCL could have an immediate price impact on the value of ADA, thus diminishing the purchase power of the 350M ADA. Before the budget elements are approved. \n\nAfter approving a large NCL, the budgetary discussions will probably take place in the shadow of a lower ADA/USD exchange rate. Thus we might be forced by the market to push an annual budget towards the top limit of the NCL. We could create a self-fulfilling prophesy. \n\nThe problem I see with a very large first year NCL is that our budgetary and governance processes are the weakest and most inefficient in the first year. Our ability to audit, prevent waste and abuse are questionable. A lower NCL would focus minds.\n\nWithout a monetary/economic analysis or forecast, I would consider voting for a NCL in the 200-250M ADA in 2025 (depending on the text of the NCL proposal) as it would give a better signal to the market about our intentions to balance the development of the system and the intention to safeguard the value of ADA and Cardano's Top 10 position. Especially, as our abilities to manage the potential spending of so much ADA in the early days of decentralized governance are the lowest. \n\nI see this conservative approach as something that protects the interests of ADA holders and stakers. \n\nBest practice: We SHOULD approve the closest NCL to the actual budget that we want as DReps. By approving a much larger NCL we will be devaluing the ada currency BEFORE any budget is approved and before the contractors receive the ADA. Effectively crippling ourselves unnecessarily. \n\nIf the intention is to approve a lower budget than 350M ada as some (many?) DReps seem to have indicated, then to preserve the value of that ada for those who will receive it, the best thing we can do is to vote for an NCL that is closest to that intended 2025 budget total."

Drafting a budget consisting of potentially $100’s Millions of dollars annually for an entire ecosystem and executing it should have ZERO participation from amateurs with no experience and subject matter expertise. \n\nProfessionals should have be retained on behalf of the community. \n\nIntersect could have asked DReps, on-chain, for the mandate to screen, recruit and retain said experts. \n\nThat’s one vote.\n\nSecond vote is design of process.\n\nThird vote is creating funding categories.\n\nFourth vote is on $$ allocation and priorities.\n\nAnd so on…..\n\nEvery vote should have been DRep led. Potentially facilitated by Intersect.\n\nAt no point whatsoever should Intersect, whom are entirely unqualified for this task, took it on themselves to create the budget.\n\nIt’s time to pivot, make up on lost ground and time and execute.

I’ll keep this explanation straightforward, especially for those who may not be deeply involved yet in Cardano governance.\n\nWhat I Voted For\n\nI am supporting funding in the following strategic areas:\n\n- Zero Knowledge (ZK) Solutions (zkFold, ZK Bridge, Atlas PAB Hydra Integrations, etc.)\n\n- Cardano Node Development and Maintenance (Core Engineering, Rust Nodes, Maintenance Proposals)\n\n- Libraries and Developer Tooling (Pallas, MLabs Libraries, Extended Symbolic, Lucid, etc.)\n\n- Bitcoin Interoperability (Complete Web3 stack for Cardano-Bitcoin bridge)\n\n- Layer 2 Scaling Solutions (Midgard Rollups, Hydra integrations)\n\nReflections and Honest Assessment\n\nI want to be honest: I could not deeply analyze every single proposal.\n\nI focused primarily on:\n\n- Proposals from well-recognized teams in the ecosystem\n\n- Proposals I was directly asked to analyze\n\n- Proposals aligned with my beliefs of Cardano’s current priorities\n\nGiven the sheer volume (almost 200 proposals) and the limited time and support tools we currently have as DReps, this was an intense and imperfect process.\nIf you think I missed an important proposal, feel free to DM me — I’m happy to review it again.\n\nBudget Distribution Summary\n\n- CORE: 190,222,949 - 55.11%\n- Research: 29,598,000 - 8.57%\n- Gov-Support: 111,643,123 - 32.34%\n- Marketing: 94,623,933 - 27.41%\n- None: 766,800 - 0.22%\n\nTotal: 345,161,209 ADA\n\nWhy So Much Into Marketing?\n\nSome may ask why I supported significant marketing budgets.\n\nMy view is pragmatic:\n\nCardano is not a government, it's closer to a startup at this stage.\n\nIn a highly competitive crypto environment, growth is critical.\n\nAccumulating millions of ADA in treasury means little if we do not reinvest part of it in ecosystem expansion.\n\nI would support smaller marketing budgets in future rounds, but missing the 2025-2026 cycle would be a major strategic mistake.\n\nConclusion: Focus Areas for Next Year\n\nDReps must be compensated for the massive amount of work required. If not, simply DReps will not participate\n\nBetter tooling, AI support, and proposal management platforms are mandatory.\n\nCatalyst and Constitutional Governance must be better integrated, not siloed.\n\nThank you to everyone who submitted proposals, participated in discussions, and helped in this massive effort.

In line with my strategy, I mainly support the CORE category.\n\nThe second largest category I support is MARKETING & INNOVATION, which includes Catalyst and Cardano Summit.\n\nThis time, I chose not to support any proposals from Intersect, which was intended to assist DReps. The process, however, has been chaotic, far beyond my expectations. The NCL was approved in April, and the Budget likely won’t be finalized until May or later.\n\nThe tipping point was giving DReps just a few days to vote using a new, untested tool over a weekend. This is unacceptable. Intersect to extend the voting period, but only under pressure from DReps.\n\nI acknowledge the organizational changes happening within Intersect and hope they resolve their issues and regain trust.

          "text": "我投票反对 ⛔️ 将Net Change Limit (NCL) 降至2亿ADA，这是迄今为止最艰难的治理决策之一。\n\n感觉这里没有完全好的选择。\n\n而且，我自己也曾呼吁降低NCL。\n\n目前3.5亿ADA的NCL存在一些明显的缺点。\n\n如果巨大的抛售压力导致ADA价格大幅下跌，比如跌至0.2美元，可能会导致严重的挑战。\n\n以美元计价为生态系统提供资金将需要从国库中出售大量ADA，从而导致抛售压力的螺旋式上升，使情况进一步恶化。\n\nCardano Whale (@cardano_whale) 指出，像Tezos和Polkadot这样的一些项目在其生态系统中投入了大量资金，拥有创新技术，但仍难以获得实质性的关注。\n\n我完全同意这一点。\n\n对于区块链而言，保持在前十大市值排名中至关重要。\n\n散户投资者、机构和加密货币爱好者不仅根据技术，还根据市场表现来评估项目。\n\n如果Cardano长期跌出前十名，无论其去中心化程度或像Ouroboros Leios这样的技术进步如何，它可能永远无法重回 прежнее положение。\n\n这是一个需要考虑的重要因素，即使感觉不公平或主观。\n\n另一方面，将NCL降至2亿ADA也存在其自身的担忧。\n\nCardano需要投资来推进其技术，支持建设者并发展生态系统。如果没有增加的用户活动，国库收入将无法增长。\n\n未来几年在维护和开发上的支出可能会耗尽储备，最终使Cardano在经济上不可持续。\n\n协议安全性也取决于有吸引力的质押奖励和激励措施。此外，如果没有活跃的开发者、工具和不断发展的DeFi生态系统，Ouroboros Leios的潜力将无法发挥。所有这些领域的投资都至关重要。\n\nIOG已经明确了他们的资金需求：Core Dev需要9600万ADA，Catalyst需要6900万ADA，Research需要2700万ADA。总计1.92亿ADA。IOG的提议很简单：要么批准这笔资金，要么就算了。\n\n关于公平性、IOG和Charles过去的贡献以及Cardano“完成”定义的辩论自有其道理，但现实是IOG在协议方面拥有无与伦比的专业知识。没有任何其他实体能够以相同的速度或质量有效地接管维护、开发和研究。\n\n如果DReps将1.92亿ADA分配给IOG，那么其他项目只剩下800万ADA。\n\n在审查了预算提案后，我只支持了我认为生态系统绝对需要的基本项目：像Midgard、Starstream、Hydra、ZK Rollups、Blockfrost、Lucid、Chainlink集成等项目。\n\n仅CORE类别一项，就大约需要1200万ADA。所有类别的总批准预算达到2.13亿ADA。\n\n鉴于我自己估计所需支出为2.13亿ADA，我无法支持2亿ADA的NCL。\n\n这将与我对必要项目资金的立场与我批准的上限相矛盾。这种不一致性导致我决定投票反对降低NCL。\n\nCardano需要有效的营销和改进的治理支持，因为目前的情况远非理想。\n\n投资生态系统和推进新技术必须齐头并进，以确保持续增长。\n\n在我看来，批准2亿ADA的NCL意味着维持现状，将所有关键职责留给IOG，同时忽视对更广泛生态系统的投资。\n\n从本质上讲，这将限制对那些对生态系统至关重要的实体的资助，就像IOG一样。\n\n一个重要的考虑因素是围绕NCL的预期情景。\n\n在我看来，3.5亿ADA和2亿ADA这两个NCL都是极端的。\n\n目前的NCL设定为3.5亿ADA，得到了76%参与投票权益的强力支持。几乎所有投票权益都批准了它。将NCL从3.5亿ADA大幅削减至2亿ADA，要么是不负责任，要么是过于雄心勃勃。\n\n接下来会发生什么？建设者、Intersect、IOG或其他方面可能会提交一项新的治理行动，提议一个中间的NCL，也许是2.5亿或3亿ADA。或者，可能会同时提交多个提案。\n\n这种情况将造成一个不稳定、适得其反且难以支持的环境。这种不稳定会破坏进展。\n\n此外，加密社区对Cardano生态系统能够负担多少投资的长时间辩论兴趣不大。\n\n在不稳定的环境中，即使提出一个连贯的预算也几乎是不可能的。\n\n目前，我们的NCL为3.5亿ADA。考虑一下这种可能的情景：\n\nIntersect预计将提交一项于6月份到期的预算治理行动。与此同时，如果到5月底批准了2亿ADA的新NCL，那么拟议的预算实际上将变得违宪，除非在新NCL生效前获得批准。\n\n这使得流程复杂化，并进一步凸显了突然、极端变化带来的问题。\n\n通过治理行动来辩论NCL既效率低下又过于耗时。\n\n社区的共识似乎很可能在2.5亿至3亿ADA之间。然而，在链上投票之前没有进行任何链下意向调查（大多数社区成员会对此做出回应），这导致当前的NCL仅仅是为了让预算流程得以继续而被批准。\n\nNCL的概念本身开始让人觉得没有必要，因为它总是随着多数票的变化而变化。如果投票权益同意增加或减少NCL，这必然会发生。\n\n重要的是要强调，NCL并不决定必须从国库中支出的金额。每一项提款提案仍需社区批准。\n\n如果目前的提案在2.5亿至3亿ADA的范围内，我可能会投赞成票。如果提交了这样的提案，我会支持它，因为它符合我认为基于我所认可的提案的合理预算。\n\n然而，我的决定并非最终决定，可能会根据治理的未来发展而改变。\n\n例如，如果治理行动将多个提案合并导致总成本过高，或者如果IOG提案与我不支持的几个提案或我强烈反对的一个提案（例如Daedalus 2025服务增强提案）捆绑在一起，我可能会重新考虑我的立场。\n\n如果阻止糟糕预算结果的唯一方法是投票支持较低的NCL，我准备这样做。这个决定是微妙的，不能简单地以非黑即白的方式看待。\n\n我希望避免出现批准较低NCL后不可避免地导致另一次GA提交的情况。反复处理NCL既耗时又没有成效。\n\nDReps需要优先处理预算提案。\n\n如果一个较高的NCL最终资助了预算中低质量的项目，那么它就毫无意义。\n\n我的DRep ID：\ndrep1km69g7ksf8t5g0h9d9tkrcd2tezxelx0wtr76rv2mrkl5nzd6v3",

          "originalText": "I voted NO ⛔️to reduce the Net Change Limit (NCL) to 200M ADA, which has been one of the toughest governance decisions so far. \n\nIt feels like there’s no entirely good option here.\n\nMoreover, I myself called for a lower NCL.\n\nThe current NCL of 350M ADA has some notable drawbacks.\n\nIf high selling pressure causes ADA’s price to drop significantly, say to 0.2 USD, it could result in serious challenges. \n\nFunding the ecosystem in dollar terms would require selling a large amount of ADA from the treasury, leading to a spiral of selling pressure that could worsen the situation.\n\nCardano Whale (@cardano_whale) pointed out that some projects like Tezos and Polkadot have invested heavily in their ecosystems, possess innovative technologies, yet struggle to gain substantial attention.\n\nI fully agree with that.\n\nFor blockchains, maintaining a presence in the top 10 market capitalization rankings is vital.\n\nRetail investors, institutions, and crypto enthusiasts evaluate projects not only based on technology but also on market performance. \n\nIf Cardano drops out of the top 10 for an extended period, it may never regain its position, regardless of decentralization or technological progress like Ouroboros Leios. \n\nThis is an important factor to consider, even if it feels unfair or subjective.\n\nOn the other hand, reducing the NCL to 200M ADA comes with its own set of concerns.\n\nCardano needs investments to advance its technology, support builders, and develop the ecosystem. Without increased user activity, Treasury revenue won't grow. \n\nSpending on maintenance and development in the next years risks exhausting the reserve, ultimately making Cardano economically unsustainable.\n\nProtocol security also hinges on attractive staking rewards and incentives. Moreover, Ouroboros Leios’s potential will remain untapped without active developers, tools, and a growing DeFi ecosystem. Investments in all these areas are crucial.\n\nIOG has made their funding requirements clear: Core Dev needs 96M ADA, Catalyst 69M ADA, and Research 27M ADA. Combined, this totals 192M ADA. The offer from IOG is simple: either approve this funding or let it be.\n\nDebates around fairness, IOG and Charles’s past contributions, and the definition of “completion” for Cardano have their place, but the reality is that IOG holds unmatched expertise in the protocol. No other entity can effectively take over maintenance, development, and research at the same pace or quality.\n\nIf DReps allocate 192M ADA to IOG, only 8M ADA remains for other projects.\n\nAfter reviewing budget proposals, I supported only the essentials I believe the ecosystem absolutely needs: projects like Midgard, Starstream, Hydra, ZK Rollups, Blockfrost, Lucid, Chainlink integration, and others. \n\nFor the CORE category alone, this amounts to around 12M ADA. Across all categories, my total approved budget comes to 213M ADA.\n\nGiven my own estimate of required expenditures is 213M ADA, I cannot support an NCL of 200M ADA. \n\nIt would contradict my stance on necessary project funding versus the cap I approve. This inconsistency guided my decision to vote NO on reducing the NCL.\n\nCardano requires effective marketing and improved governance support, as the current situation is far from ideal.\n\nInvesting in the ecosystem and advancing new technologies must go hand in hand to ensure sustainable growth.\n\nApproving the NCL of 200M ADA, in my view, would mean preserving the status quo, leaving all key responsibilities to IOG while neglecting investment in the broader ecosystem. \n\nEssentially, it would restrict funding for entities that are vital to the ecosystem, just as IOG is.\n\nAn important consideration is the expected scenarios surrounding the NCL.\n\nBoth NCLs, an NCL of 350M ADA and 200M ADA, are extremes in my view.\n\nThe current NCL, set at 350M ADA, has strong support with 76% of the voting stake participating. Nearly the entire voting stake approved it. Drastically reducing the NCL from 350M to 200M ADA would be either irresponsible or overly ambitious.\n\nWhat would happen next? Builders, Intersect, IOG, or others would likely submit a new governance action proposing an intermediate NCL, perhaps 250M or 300M ADA. Alternatively, multiple proposals could be submitted simultaneously.\n\nThis scenario would create an unstable environment that is counterproductive and difficult to support. Such instability undermines progress.\n\nMoreover, the crypto community has little interest in prolonged debates about how much the Cardano ecosystem can afford to invest.\n\nIn an unstable environment, even proposing a coherent budget becomes nearly impossible.\n\nCurrently, we have an NCL of 350M ADA. Consider this likely scenario:\n\nIntersect is expected to submit a governance action for the budget expiring in June. Meanwhile, if a new NCL of 200M ADA is approved by the end of May, the proposed budget would effectively become unconstitutional unless it is approved before the new NCL takes effect. \n\nThis complicates the process and further highlights the issues with sudden, extreme changes.\n\nDebating the NCL through governance actions is both inefficient and overly time-consuming.\n\nIt seems likely that the community's consensus would fall somewhere between 250M–300M ADA. However, no off-chain temperature check was conducted (to which the majority of the community would respond) before the on-chain vote, which led to the current NCL being approved simply to allow the budgeting process to continue.\n\nThe concept of the NCL itself is starting to feel unnecessary, as it constantly shifts based on the majority vote. If the voting stake agrees to increase or decrease the NCL, it will inevitably happen.\n\nIt’s important to emphasize that the NCL doesn’t dictate the amount that must be spent from the treasury. Every withdrawal proposal still requires approval from the community.\n\nI would likely vote YES if the current proposal fell within the 250M–300M ADA range. If a proposal like this is submitted, I would support it, as it aligns with the budget I consider reasonable based on the proposals I have endorsed.\n\nHowever, my decision isn’t final and may change depending on future developments in governance. \n\nFor instance, if governance actions combine multiple proposals that result in an excessively high total cost, or if the IOG proposal is grouped with several proposals I don’t support, or one I strongly oppose, such as the Daedalus 2025 Service Enhancement, I might reconsider my stance.\n\nIf the only way to prevent a poor budget outcome is to vote for a lower NCL, I am prepared to do so. This decision is nuanced and cannot be seen in black-and-white terms.\n\nI want to avoid a scenario where approving a lower NCL inevitably results in another GA submission. Addressing the NCL repeatedly is time-consuming and unproductive. \n\nDReps need to prioritize budget proposals instead.\n\nA higher NCL serves no purpose if it ends up funding low-quality projects within the budget.\n\nMy DRep ID:\ndrep1km69g7ksf8t5g0h9d9tkrcd2tezxelx0wtr76rv2mrkl5nzd6v3"

          "text": "是时候报告我最近的投票了！长文如下 👇\n\n从NCL开始，我投票赞成更大的3.5亿上限。主要理由是资金延迟可能对Cardano上的许多小型项目造成不利影响。没有NCL，国库无法提款，所以我们需要设立一个。现在这个问题解决了，我正在考虑将上限降至2亿是否合理。目前，我倾向于不这样做，因为我相信我们正处于生态系统的关键时刻，必须积极投入资源以弥补我们落后的领域。\n\n关于预算项目，我的流程如下。由于时间有限，我优先考虑了a) 对预算影响较大的较昂贵项目和b) 我具有一定专业知识的较技术性项目。我的默认选项是“弃权”，用于我认为无法就为何应接受或拒绝提案提供充分见解的情况。我显然对@zkFold的提案存在偏见，但我试图根据每个提案自身的价值来考虑，而不是它将如何使我们公司受益（如下所示）。我还非常关注成本。我相信（几乎？）没有不可替代的供应商，因此在产出和成本方面总有谈判的余地。以下所有内容都是我作为DRep的个人观点。我投票表决的值得注意的项目：\n\n- @InputOutputHK的研究提案是最容易投票的提案之一。我们绝对应该推进这些研究项目，因为它们为我们的生态系统提供了超越竞争对手的优势。而且考虑到所有因素，价格标签是适中的。\n\n- 接下来，我还投票赞成了@InputOutputHK的开发提案。大多数项目对我来说都很有意义，尽管成本很高。这是一件小事，但我确实希望Babel fees项目不仅仅是这样宣传的，而是实际上是一个部分平衡交易的综合解决方案。Babel fees正由不同的生态系统参与者独立实施，包括@FluidTokens和@zkFold。它们本身并不需要硬分叉。而这个单一项目（Babel fees）的预算就超过了@zkFold的年度预算。\n\n- 然后，我投票支持了@zkFold的提案以及@AnastasiaLabs的Midgard和@SebastienGllmt的Starstream。我认为所有这些技术与其价格相比都能产生巨大的影响。是的，它们之间存在一些重叠，但我们不知道事情会如何发展，所以进行许多具有100倍潜力的小额押注对我来说最有意义。\n\n- 我有些犹豫地投票支持了Project Catalyst预算。一方面，路线图看起来非常有前景。我确实喜欢提案中写的内容。另一方面，成本非常高，而且在我看来，Project Catalyst为提案者提供的体验一直在下降。鉴于Cardano治理自早期基金以来已经成熟，我们可以减少官僚作风和开销，而不是增加！生态系统现在可以更有效地筛选不良提案，而无需Catalyst团队的指导。而当需要Catalyst团队的调解时，却又缺乏。但总而言之，Catalyst对生态系统非常有益。\n\n- 我对Tweag提案投了“反对”票，因为其他DReps的担忧尚未得到妥善解决，而且TSC的审查又增加了更多问题（法国每个开发人员30万以上，真的吗？）。\n\n- 我对Intersect提案投了“反对”票。TSC周围的情况令人担忧，在我看来，这凸显了该组织极端的中心化程度。该提案要求巨额资金，而支出项目却含糊不清。我们正在创建一些无法自行做出任何决定、充当董事会高薪分析师的委员会。至少在我看来是这样。乐于被纠正。\n\n- 最后，我投票赞成了@TxPipe的提案，因为过去他们生产了出色的产品，为众多Cardano项目降低了开发成本。此外，这些工具不易变现，因此生态系统应该支持它们。",

          "originalText": "It’s time to report on my recent votes! Long read below 👇\n\nStarting with the NCL, I voted in favor of a larger 350m limit. The main reasoning was that a delay in funding could be detrimental for many smaller projects on Cardano. Without the NCL, treasury withdrawals cannot be done, so we needed to set up one. Now that this problem is solved, I am considering whether it makes sense to lower the limit to 200m. Currently, leaning no on this one as I believe we are at a critical moment for the ecosystem and have to spend resources aggressively to catch up in the areas where we are lagging.\n\nRegarding the budget items, my process was as follows. Having limited time, I prioritized a) more expensive items that have a bigger impact on the budget and b) more technical items where I have some expertise. My default was the “abstain” option, which I used in situations where I felt I could not offer a good insight on why the proposal should be accepted or rejected. I am obviously biased about @zkFold’s proposals, but I tried to consider every proposal on its own merit and not how it would benefit us as a company (as you can see below). I also paid a lot of attention to the costs. I believe there’s (almost?) no irreplaceable vendors, and so there’s always room for negotiation with regards to outputs and cost. Everything below is my personal opinion as a DRep. Notable items that I voted on:\n\n- @InputOutputHK's research proposal was one of the easiest votes. We should definitely advance in those research items as they provide our ecosystem with an edge over the competition. And the price tag is moderate, all things considered.\n\n- Next, I also voted in favor of the @InputOutputHK's development proposal. Most of the items make total sense to me, although the cost is high. It is a minor thing, but I do hope the Babel fees project is just marketed as such, but is actually a comprehensive solution for partially balanced transactions. Babel fees are being implemented independently by different ecosystem players, including @FluidTokens and @zkFold. They do not require a hardfork, per se. And the budget for this single item (babel fees) is more than @zkFold's yearly budget.\n\n- Then, I voted for @zkFold’s proposals as well as @AnastasiaLabs's Midgard and @SebastienGllmt's Starstream. I think all these technologies can have a huge impact compared to their price. Yes, there is some overlap between those, but we don’t know how things play out, so making many small bets with 100x potential makes the most sense to me.\n\n- With some hesitation, I voted for the Project Catalyst budget. On the one hand, the roadmap looks really promising. I do like what is written in the proposal. On the other hand, the cost is very high, and the Project Catalyst experience for proposers has been degrading, in my opinion. Given that the Cardano governance has matured since early funds, we can afford to have less bureaucracy and overhead, not more! The ecosystem can now filter bad proposals much more efficiently without Catalyst’s team handholding. And when the Catalyst’s team mediation is needed, it is lacking. All in all, though, Catalyst has been highly beneficial for the ecosystem.\n\n- I voted “no” on the Tweag proposal as the concerns of other DReps have not been properly cleared, and the TSC review added more on top (300k+ per developer in France, really?).\n\n- I voted “no” on the Intersect proposal. The situation around TSC is concerning, and, in my opinion, it highlights the extreme degree of centralization in the organization. The proposal asks for a huge sum, while the expense items are vague. We are creating committees that cannot make any decisions on their own and serve as very expensive analysts for the board. At least, that’s how it looks to me. Happy to be corrected.\n\n- Finally, I voted in favor of @TxPipe’s proposals as, in the past, they’ve produced great products that reduced development costs for numerous Cardano projects. Plus, it is not easy to monetize those tools, so the ecosystem should support them."

          "originalText": "I encourage all DReps to vote \"YES\" to fund @IntersectMBO for 2025-2026. \n\nInteresect's funding proposal: https://t.co/eNrxNfASyK\n\n---\n\nAdditional Notes: \n\nI am a member of the Intersect's Cardano Budget Committee (@IntersectCBC). I joined in order to build a process for builders, developers, and marketers to apply for and receive funding from the Treasury via DRep approval. Developing this process has been difficult at times, but I believe that Intersect is on the right track, and it is in our interest as a Community to fund and further develop this Institution. At present, this is our best vehicle for involving the broader @Cardano community in on-chain governance.\n\n- (1) Intersect will serve as Administrator for Treasury-funded contracts - All proposals that have received a \"YES\" vote from the DReps need an Administrator. To my knowledge, no other organization has stepped forward to act as an Administrator for these proposals. Intersect can serve in this vital role. \n\n- (2) Intersect does not have sole control over Treasury fund disbursement - Intersect will work within a set of multiple key holders to administer the smart contract that releases funds to the teams. They will not unilaterally withhold or release funds. This set of key holders will represent the builders in the Cardano community. \n  \n- (3) Processes and performance - We should judge this organization based on its failures but its successes. While imperfect, Intersect has helped pass a Cardano net change limit and has arrived at a Budget Reconciliation process with Ekklesia.  The Cardano Annual Budget process is now working. In 2022-2024, in conjunction with IOG, Intersect successfully coordinated a global conversation around the governance guardrail CIP-1694 and the first Constitution for Cardano. This was also a hugely successful effort. Let's not lose sight of the forest for the trees: Intersect is functioning. \n  \n- (4) Leadership and community involvement - Jack Briggs (@JBriggsLondon) is leading the work at Intersect with Nick Cook (@NC_IntersectMBO), and I believe in their leadership. I also personally know many of the team members at Intersect, and I vouch for their efficacy and diligence in their work. These team members are on the ground at events, they are participating online in discussion, and they are accessible to the community. Additionally, we have just seen community members newly elected to all Intersect committees. I believe that these leaders will steer Intersect to an even better state.\n  \n- (5) Time limit - This funding will be only for one year. If we find that Intersect does not do its job or meaningfully advance the interests of the Cardano community through its efforts, I will not call for support for this organization again.\n\n- (6) Demonstrated willingness to listen and to change - This organization has listened to community feedback and has revised its approach multiple times. It is sensitive to the will of the Cardano community and will continue to iterate until they get things right. In my mind, this is the essence of the Age of Voltaire. Nobody gave us a playbook as a Community, and folks took a chance to work at a new organization and adapt as quickly as possible while enduring intense, deserved scrutiny. I believe this willingness to listen and adapt gives them the mandate to lead."

Intersect（或DReps可接受的、担任管理员的其他实体）确保预算监督、透明度和审计——宪法要求所有国库提款都必须包含独立审计和监督指标的拨款。Intersect（或DReps可接受的、担任管理员的其他实体）通过管理独立的、可审计的账户并实施与治理相关的争议解决来履行这一职责。\n→ 宪法参考：第四条，第四节和第五节\n\n5. Intersect（或DReps可接受的、担任管理员的其他实体）维持治理基础设施——宪法期望社区维持链下治理流程。作为MBO，Intersect支持包括工具、流程管理和宪法委员会运营需求在内的基本基础设施。如果Intersect不复存在，则必须有另一个实体来承担这一角色。\n→ 宪法参考：第三条，第六节；第七条，第七节和第八节\n\n6. 没有管理员会危及整个治理模式——Intersect（或其他管理员）的行政职能是Cardano治理的基础和强制性组成部分。没有获得资助的管理员，任何基于国库的治理行动都无法进行，这会削弱DReps的决策，并威胁去中心化治理的连续性。\n→ 宪法参考：第四条，第二至五节；第七条，第四节",

          "originalText": "Love the amazing passive and debate of the DReps.  Shows the beauty of Cardano Community led governance.  Thought it might be helpful to post for everyone what the Cardano Constitution requires:\n\n1. An administrator Is Constitutionally Required--\nThe Constitution mandates that all Cardano ecosystem budgets must designate one or more administrators to oversee treasury funds. Without Intersect acting as administrator (or the emergence of a different administrator acceptable to DReps) no budget can fulfill this requirement.\n→ Constitution Reference: Article IV, Section 2\n\n2. No Administrator means no budget—and No Governance Execution--\nTreasury withdrawals cannot occur unless they are part of an approved budget and under the supervision of a designated administrator. Without funding for Intersect (or the emergence of a different administrator acceptable to DReps) there is no administrator—effectively halting the execution of any governance action involving treasury funds.\n→ Constitution Reference: Article IV, Sections 2 & 3; Guardrails TREASURY-04a\n\n3. Administrators Enable Treasury Withdrawals--\nOnly an approved budget that includes an administrator allows treasury withdrawals. Intersect (or a different entity acceptable to DReps, acting as the administrator) is thus essential to implement any community-approved funding, ensuring the budget's legitimacy and compliance.\n→ Constitution Reference: Article IV, Sections 2 & 3; Guardrails TREASURY-01a to TREASURY-04a\n\n4. Intersect (or  a different entity acceptable to DReps) acting as the administrator, ensures Budget Oversight, Transparency, and Audits--\nThe Constitution requires that all treasury withdrawals include allocations for independent audits and oversight metrics. Intersect (or  a different entity acceptable to DReps, acting as the administrator) fulfills this role by managing separate, auditable accounts and implementing governance-related dispute resolution.\n→ Constitution Reference: Article IV, Section 4 & 5\n\n5. Intersect (or a different entity acceptable to DReps, acting as the administrator) sustains Governance Infrastructure--\nThe Constitution expects the community to maintain off-chain governance processes. Intersect, as an MBO, supports essential infrastructure including tooling, process administration, and the Constitutional Committee’s operational needs. Another entity would have to step up to take on this role if Intersect ceases to exist.\n→ Constitution Reference: Article III, Section 6; Article VII, Sections 7 & 8\n\n6. No Administrator Risks the Entire Governance Model-\nIntersect’s (or a different  administrator's) administrative function is foundational and mandatory to Cardano’s governance. Without a funded administrator, no treasury-based governance actions can proceed, undermining DReps’ decisions and threatening the continuity of decentralized governance.\n→ Constitution Reference: Article IV, Sections 2–5; Article VII, Section 4"

          "text": "DReps拥有绝对的权利拒绝Intersect的预算提案。这真是了不起的民主实践！接下来会发生的是，一个或多个替代管理员必须出现并获得资金。所有先前批准的、指定Intersect为其管理员的预算都必须重新提交，并且必须进行新的投票。在重新提交的预算提案中确定的新管理员也必须单独提交他们自己的资金预算提案。朝这个方向发展是Cardano社区的权利。当然，这很可能导致任何国库提款至少延迟3到6个月，从而可能对Cardano的持续运营造成风险。然而，这同样是由Cardano社区决定的。这些确实是具有挑战性的问题，但看到我们的DReps参与如此重要的辩论和思考，真是太棒了。",

What would happen next is that one or more alternative administrators would have to emerge and get funding.  All previously approved budgets that had designated Intersect as their administrator would have to be resubmitted and new votes would have to take place.  The new administrator or administrators identified in resubmitted budget proposals would have to also separately submit their own budget proposals for funding.  Going this direction is the right of the Cardano Community.  Of course it would likely result in a delay of any treasury withdrawals by at least 3 to 6 months, potentially creating a risk for the ongoing operation of Cardano.  Again, however, this is for the Cardano community to decide.  Challenging problems indeed but so wonderful to see our DReps engaging in such important debates and considerations."

          "originalText": "🔥 It is time 🔥 I've completed my voting for the Intersect Budget on Ekklesia.\n\nMy primary votes cast were based on a potential NCL of 200M $ADA\n\nThat meant getting core essentials funded with not much left over.\n\nMy primary support went to funding @InputOutputHK and @Catalyst_onX \n\nHowever, my personal NCL is 250M ADA, and that left much more room for needed funding for #Cardano\n\nIf someone submits a NCL of 250M, you'll have my vote as well 👀\n\nMy total spend was 247,316,767 ADA\n\nMy complete vote history:\nhttps://t.co/JvcruoAc5x\n\nMy Budget Breakdown:\nhttps://t.co/5NvbG8I4k5\n\nMy DRep ID:\ndrep1ytxr0lhg5j72wysva9ac2gsn4lck4gyen8ywxkqfchsqg3qs8uy44\n\nMy other top picks were:\n\n✅Starstream: next gen VM by @PaimaStudios \n✅Cardano Ecosystem Pavilions at Exhibitions by @invalid_eutxo @DiscoverCardano \n✅Unlock BTC Liquidity with Cardano Smart Contracts\n+\n✅Open-Source Composable Smart Contracts Audit Funding by Danogo @danogo_2023 \n✅Hardware Wallets Maintenance by @vacuumlabs \n\nThe last proposal to fit under 200M NCL was: \n\n✅MLabs Core Tool Maintenance & Enhancement: Cardano.nix by @MLabs10 \n\nFor a NCL of 250M ADA, the proposals and aspects that I think need the most attention are:\n\nCritical Infrastructure + Maintenance Costs:\n\nThere are so many that fit in this category requesting funds. Midgard, #Bitcoin integration, and Zk Rollups were top of mind, but key suppliers include:\n\n@MLabs10 @tweagio @txpipe_tools @zkFold  @AnastasiaLabs @GeniusyieldO @DripDropz_io  @cexplorer_io @ada_stat @eternlwallet @nftcdn_io  @adahandle \n\nThe OSC Budget Proposal - Paid Open Source Model for Sustainable Development should also be funded.\n\nCritical Governance Support:\n\n1⃣ Cardano Constitutional Committee Formation and Governance Training with the SanchoNet Education Network by @Hornan7\n\nThis is a must to continue the future of on chain governance.\n\n2⃣ Quality Assurance: On-Chain & Off-Chain Audit by @jrv97_velazquez\n\nWe need an independent audit process for fund distribution, and this was by far the best proposal.\n\nMarketing by the community, not CF or Emurgo:\n\n1⃣Cardano Ecosystem Pavilions at Exhibitions\n2⃣Amplify Cardano: Community-Led Events Fund by Rare Network @RareEvo \n3⃣Amplify Cardano: Community-Led Marketing Fund by Rare Network\n4⃣Cardano Rising: Japan Delegation to Rare Evo for Media and Enterprise Impact by Lightning Communications\n5⃣Cardano Japan Renaissance by Pacific Meta Inc.\n\nMarketing by CF @Cardano_CF :\n\n✅Cardano Summit 2025 and regional tech events\n\nThe CF has multiple marketing proposals, but this is the only one I feel they would be best to deliver.\n\nThey also have a very high ask, and I believe they should be compensated partially for their marketing efforts (like the Cardano summit), but not everything.\n\nThe CF has genesis ADA they should be spending for the betterment of the Cardano community.\n\n❌ No Proposals by Emurgo @emurgo_io \n\nThey have a pile of genesis ADA that they should be using to fund marketing and business initiatives as the business arm of Cardano.\n\nInstead they are using genesis ADA to downvote competing marketing proposals by actual Cardano community members.\n\nThere is a serious conflict of interest going on with Emurgo / @YoroiWallet and the use of genesis ADA and wallet delegations to their benefit.\n\nI will not support this kind of blatant abuse of our governance system and treasury funds.\n\nIntersect @IntersectMBO  didn't convince me that they should get 15 Million ADA in operations cost, so they also got a no vote.\n\nOverall I appreciate all the work that has been put into making this happen by everyone.\n\nIf I voted no on your proposal, it was likely due to cost constraints, that the proposal was better suited to Catalyst, or that there was not enough information provided to justify voting yes.\n\nI left feedback for some proposals, but due to time constraints not all.\n\nA huge thanks goes out to @adamKDean and @MadOrkestra for making Ekklesia 🔥\n\nAnother big thanks goes out to all the volunteers and community members who got us this far, and to all the DReps who truly care and contributed.\n\nThank you so much!❤️"

          "text": "正如我们许多人预期的那样，NCL因此成为了目标，而Intersect刚刚在链上发布了一个高达2.75亿ADA的巨额预算信息行动。我投了反对票。\n\n我已多次解释——大概不仅仅代表我自己，而是代表更多人——不要这样操作。在这里，我们看到一个预算请求，将我认为至关重要的技术工作与在我看来至少有可能是彻头彻尾骗局的内容捆绑在一起。\n\n我们发现自己处于这样一种境地：被迫接受约1.25亿充其量算是锦上添花的支出（链上垃圾信息过滤器很可能一开始就阻止了这些支出），以及约1.5亿的关键技术工作。这些工作本身在某些情况下成本如此高昂，以至于链上治理流程和DRep群体应该被允许在批准前直接参与其中。\n\n在之前的投票中，我已经详细解释了为什么我们不能过度进行国库支出。概括而言：\n\n我们正在调整货币政策，将国库视为财政甚至预算的视角是错误的。\n\n加密货币的核心是通货紧缩，Bitcoin目前的通缩率低于1%（这给所有人带来了压力，2025年不同于2020年），而Cardano则低于2%。在BNB和Tron等其他协议不得不手动销毁两位数供应量以维持在前十名左右的时候，国库支出带来了新的通货膨胀。\n\n如果这项支出伴随着Cardano的采用或即将到来的重大改进，那可能是值得的，但它不能是随意的，谨慎开始是合理的。我认为Intersect的这项预算提案是随意的，并希望以此表达我对整个过程的不满。\n\n投票从第一天起就应该在链上进行，由全体DRep审查，并应用适当的垃圾信息过滤器。最多也就是像我们在Midgard和Starstream看到的那样，将几个成本效益高且高度相关的较小提案捆绑在一起。\n\n而且，即使我们将此视为一种财政预算，预算也不是要找出有多少项目拥有足够多的人愿意为其花钱。而是要将这些偏好与一系列考虑因素结合起来，首先要了解我们到底能花多少钱，然后再有选择性地花钱。\n\n我和许多其他人一直担心的，即NCL成为目标而非约束，现在正得到验证。我不认为2025-26年的市场有能力承受3.5亿ADA甚至2.75亿ADA的发行量。\n\n我之前已就此流程提出过投诉，并多次表示我无法支持这样的预算。我将再次重申，我们目前所走的这条支出道路是Cardano目前面临的最大风险。我对此感到担忧。",

          "originalText": "As many of us expected, the NCL thus becomes the target and Intersect just put a gargantuan 275m ADA budget info action on-chain. I voted against.\n\nI have repeatedly explained - presumably on behalf of a few more people than just my little old self - not to play it like this. Here we see a budget request bucketing what I consider critical tech work with what in my mind at least have the potential to be downright scams.\n\nWe see ourselves in the position where we are forced to accept ~125m of, at best, nice to have spending that the on-chain spam filters likely would have stopped in its tracks, along with ~150m of critical tech work. Work that itself in some cases comes with such a hefty price tag that the on-chain governance process and DRep set should be allowed to directly engage with it before approving. \n\nIn prior votes I have at length explained why we cannot be too excessive with treasury disbursements. High level: \n\nWe’re tinkering with monetary policy, it is a mistake to view the treasury through a fiscal or even budgetary lens. \n\nCrypto is about disinflation, Bitcoin is sub 1% now (putting everyone under pressure, 2025 is not 2020) while Cardano is sub 2%. Treasury spending introduces new inflation at a time other protocols like BNB and Tron have manually had to burn double digits of supply to stay around the top 10. \n\nIf this spending comes along with adoption or big imminent improvements to Cardano it may be worth it, but it can’t be haphazard and it makes sense to start cautiously. I consider this Intersect budget proposal to be haphazard, and want to flag my discontent with the entire process. \n\nVoting should have been done on-chain from day 1, scrutinised by the full DRep set and with appropriate spam filters applied. Maybe at most bucketing several smaller cost effective and highly related proposals like we saw with Midgard and Starstream.\n\nBut also, even if we were to see this exercise as a sort of fiscal budgeting, budgeting is not about finding out how many items have a critical mass of people who would like to spend on them. It’s about combining those preferences with a set of considerations that include first understanding how much we CAN spend first, and then being SELECTIVE about it. \n\nThe worry I and many others have had, that the NCL becomes the target instead of a constraint, is now turning out to be valid. I don’t think the market in 2025-26 has the appetite to stomach 350m ADA in emissions, or even 275m. \n\nI have lodged complaints about the process here before and have signalled multiple times I would not be able to support such a budget. I will once again reiterate that this spending path we are on is the single biggest risk to Cardano currently. I worry."

          "text": "🚫我对由Intersect管理的2.75亿ADA的Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Budget投了反对票。\n\n理由：\n\n我强烈反对将所有提案捆绑成一个方案供DReps批准。\n\n关键提案与不太重要或不必要的提案（其中许多属于Catalyst）混杂在一起。\n\n预算责任要求对单个提案或较小的方案组做出决策，而不是一个大型方案。\n\n提案细分：\n\n• 在Ekklesia中，我投票赞成了35个提案，总计2.133亿ADA——这比Ekklesia中DReps集体批准的预算低了6200万ADA。\n\n• 对于我支持的六个提案，存在一个单独的GA——这些是大多数DReps都认为会对生态系统产生积极影响的顶级项目。\n\n• Intersect的GA包括我想支持的19个提案，总计2.042亿ADA，其中包括四个IOG项目，总预算为1.94亿ADA。\n\n• 与此同时，有14个总计6550万ADA的提案是我在Ekklesia中不支持的。\n\n假设IOG能够为其提案提交自己的GA，那么我指的是支持15个总预算为1000万ADA的我想要支持的提案。\n\n与此相对的是14个预算为6550万ADA的我不想支持的提案。\n\n作为一名DRep，我无法接受。\n\n就我而言，这种不平衡使得捆绑方式不可接受。我相信许多DReps也会为此感到困扰。\n\n首选替代方案：\n\n我敦促团队提交自己的GA，或要求Intersect按类别或门槛组织提案。\n\n• 对单个提案进行链上投票是理想的，尽管GA提交的10万ADA保证金对许多项目来说是一个挑战。\n\n• 更小、更集中的GA包将有助于做出更好的决策。\n\nNet Change Limit (NCL) 担忧：\n\n目前的NCL尚不明确，使得批准2.75亿ADA的预算为时过早。目前有两个关于NCL的活跃GA：\n\n1. 2亿ADA NCL，有效期至2025年5月29日。\n2. 3亿ADA NCL，有效期至2025年6月8日。\n\n现有的NCL获得了强有力的支持，但许多DReps可能仅仅是为了推动预算流程而支持它，并非因为他们赞成高限额。\n\n在DReps就NCL达成一致之前，批准如此庞大的预算意义不大。\n\n此GA将于2025年6月13日到期。如果两个活跃的NCL GA均未通过，从而确认了当前的NCL，我仍将有一个epoch的时间重新考虑我的投票。\n\n后续步骤及我的立场：\n\n我敦促DReps尽快对NCL GA进行投票。\n\n我仍然认为，通过对单个提案进行投票，而不是依赖NCL，才能最好地维持预算责任。让我们在链上处理这件事。\n\n我的反对票是向Intersect发出的一个信号，表明我支持流程变更。我不想批准一个价值2.75亿ADA的大型捆绑方案——我更喜欢单个投票或较小的提案包。\n\n然而，我对我在Ekklesia中投赞成票的项目的支持依然坚定。如果他们提交自己的GA，我会投赞成票。\n\n只要提案通过适当的GA提交流程，我也愿意重新考虑所有提案。\n\n最终，我认为理想的NCL应该在2.5亿ADA左右，并保留1000万ADA作为应急储备。\n\n平衡货币政策保护和生态系统投资是一项挑战——我们必须在为增长提供资金的同时，最大限度地减少抛售压力。\n\n解决方案是确保只有对长期产生积极影响的项目才能从国库中获得ADA。\n\n在我看来，当前捆绑方案中的一些提案是不必要的。\n\n我的DRep ID：\ndrep1km69g7ksf8t5g0h9d9tkrcd2tezxelx0wtr76rv2mrkl5nzd6v3",

          "originalText": "🚫I voted NO on the Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Budget of 275M ADA, administered by Intersect.\n\nRationale:\n\nI strongly oppose bundling all proposals into a single bundle for DReps to approve.\n\nCritical proposals are grouped with less important or unnecessary ones, many of which belong to Catalyst.\n\nBudget responsibility requires making decisions on individual proposals or smaller bundles, not one large one.\n\nProposal Breakdown:\n\n• In Ekklesia, I voted YES for 35 proposals totaling 213.3M ADA—which is 62M ADA lower than the collective DRep-approved budget in Ekklesia.\n\n• A separate GA exists for six of the proposals I supported—these are top-tier projects that most DReps agree will positively impact the ecosystem.\n\n• Intersect’s GA includes 19 proposals I want to support, totaling 204.2M ADA, including four IOG projects with a combined budget of 194M ADA.\n\n• At the same time, 14 proposals totaling 65.5M ADA were proposals I did not support in Ekklesia.\n\nAssuming that IOG is able to submit its own GA for their proposals, I am talking about supporting 15 proposals with a total budget of 10M ADA that I want to support. \n\nAgainst this are 14 proposals with a budget of 65.5M ADA that I do not want to support.\n\nAs a DRep, I cannot accept it.\n\nIn my case, this imbalance makes the bundled approach unacceptable. I believe that many DReps will struggle with this as well.\n\nPreferred Alternative:\n\nI urge teams to submit their own GAs or ask Intersect to structure proposals by category or threshold.\n\n• On-chain voting for individual proposals would be ideal, though the 100K ADA deposit for GA submissions is a challenge for many projects.\n\n• Smaller, more focused GA bundles would allow better decision-making.\n\nNet Change Limit (NCL) Concerns:\n\nThe current NCL is unclear, making a 275M ADA budget approval premature. There are two active GAs regarding NCL:\n\n1. 200M ADA NCL that expires May 29, 2025.\n2. 300M ADA NCL that expires June 8, 2025.\n\nThe existing NCL received strong support, but many DReps may have backed it simply to keep the budget process moving, not because they favored a high limit.\n\nUntil DReps align on the NCL, approving such a large budget makes little sense.\n\nThis GA expires June 13, 2025. If both active NCL GAs fail, confirming the current NCL, I will still have one epoch to reconsider my vote.\n\nNext Steps & My Position:\n\nI urge DReps to vote on the NCL GAs as soon as possible.\n\nI continue to believe that budgetary responsibility is best maintained by voting on individual proposals rather than relying on an NCL. Let’s handle this on-chain.\n\nMy NO vote is a signal to Intersect that I support a process change. I do not want to approve one large bundle worth 275M ADA—I prefer individual votes or smaller proposal bundles.\n\nHowever, my support for the projects I voted YES in Ekklesia remains firm. I will vote YES if they submit their own GA.\n\nI am also open to reconsidering all proposals, as long as they come through proper GA submissions.\n\nUltimately, I believe the ideal NCL should be around 250M ADA, with 10M ADA kept as a reserve for emergencies.\n\nBalancing monetary policy protection and ecosystem investment is a challenge—we must minimize selling pressure while funding growth.\n\nThe solution is ensuring that only projects with a positive long-term impact receive ADA from the Treasury.\n\nIn my view, some proposals in the current bundle are unnecessary.\n\nMy DRep ID:\ndrep1km69g7ksf8t5g0h9d9tkrcd2tezxelx0wtr76rv2mrkl5nzd6v3"

          "text": "投票 ❌：Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Budget - 275M ada Administered by Intersect\n\n===================\n如果您不同意我的反对票，请重新授权给另一位DRep。如果您重新授权给一位投赞成票的DRep，则您的投票将计为赞成票。\n===================\n\n理由\n我投票反对拟议的2025年Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Budget，因为我认为要求的总金额过高，特别是对于最低可行链上治理的第一年而言。\n\n我还认为，将39项提案捆绑在一起进行一次投票，限制了DReps表达我们在早期阶段看到的那种差异化支持的能力。这种方法抹平了细微差别，并对一系列不同的资金优先事项强加了全有或全无的决定。\n\n我还承认，存在三个创始实体，它们获得了Genesis ADA，并正在以不同程度的成功努力根据其最初的使命改进Cardano。其中一些使命名义上已经完成，一些使命以其最初的形式继续存在，一些则以新的形式继续存在。我不敢说了解所有细微差别。\n\n尽管如此，我还是将其作为我决策的一个因素。国库资金的使用应审慎，并应补充和意识到这些实体的存在。\n\n这次投票反对如此大规模的预算是基于：\n\n1. 我参与DRep投票阶段以及DRep整体参与程度；\n2. 某些提案相对于其他提案获得的支持程度；\n3. 某些提案相对于其他提案的相对重要性以及团队的质量及其对Cardano使命的奉献精神；\n4. 以及Catalyst很可能（在本次或未来的预算提案中）获得足够支持以继续支持较小的、实验性的或商业性的项目的期望。\n\n虽然从国库支出并非新鲜事（Catalyst以前就这样做过），但这是第一个主要的年度链上预算，它开创了一个先例。\n\n在我看来，问题不在于Cardano经济体内的通货膨胀——大多数ADA不会用于购买NFT或FT。也不仅仅是略高的通货紧缩率。更深层次的问题是由于外部抛售压力导致的ADA贬值。大多数受资助的ADA将被兑换成法定货币（美元、欧元等），而不是在内部循环。这给ADA的价格带来了下行压力。\n\n这是一个有其怪癖的跷跷板。\n\n在现实世界经济中，如果你投入更多资金来“启动”经济，如果服务和商品供应无法满足需求，就会面临通货膨胀。\n\n在一个仍处于萌芽阶段的区块链经济中，投入更多资金基本上意味着将原生代币兑换成法定货币，结果就是贬值。我们不是直接用ADA兑换Cardano经济商品和服务，而是将其出售到现实世界。ADA没有在内部循环。这给ADA的价格带来了下行压力。\n\n这种贬值影响到每一个人：\n\n1. 最重要的受资助项目\n2. 未获资助的项目\n3. 未申请资助的建设者\n4. 通过机会成本资助所有这一切的ADA持有者\n\n当然，这是不可避免的。分配的大部分ADA可能会被兑换成法定货币（美元、欧元等）用于支付服务，而不是在生态系统内保留或再利用。这造成了汇率压力，削弱了ADA的价值。\n\n问题不在于是否会发生贬值——它一定会发生。真正的问题是：我们的底线在哪里？这个预算中的所有39个提案所带来的价值是否都超过了它们共同造成的贬值成本？我们需要将它们全部捆绑在一个赞成/反对的预算投票中吗？我认为不需要。\n\n我们正在批准一项庞大的、以外部为重点的预算，而此时Cardano的“区块链经济”和治理机制仍不成熟且内部脆弱。\n\n国库资金应主要集中于不同形式的关键公共产品。特别是如果它们是开源的；支持基础设施、研究、工具，甚至教育、Cardano的推广。这适用于当这些产品符合Cardano作为公共基础设施的长期使命时。是的，可能会出现例外情况，但这些例外情况代价高昂——而且其他人会为此买单。\n\n如果我们过度资助影响较小的提案，我们就有可能削弱最关键提案的影响力，仅仅因为稀释了它们所获得报酬的价值。\n\n因此，我相信一个规模更小、分阶段、严格关注基础性公共产品的预算将是一个更好、更安全的起点。\n\n我将此理由作为对拟议预算行动的真诚看法，旨在通过鼓励提交者（Intersect）考虑更多因素来为这一过程做出贡献。",

          "originalText": "VOTE ❌: Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Budget - 275M ada Administered by Intersect \n\n===================\nPlease redelegate to another DRep, if you disagree with my NO vote. If you redelegate to a YES voting DRep, it will count as a YES. \n===================\n\nRATIONALE\nI am voting NO on the proposed 2025 Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Budget because I believe the total amount requested is too high, especially  for the first year of minimum viable on-chain governance. \n\nI also believe that bundling 39 proposals together into a single vote limits DReps’ ability to express the differentiated support that we saw in earlier stages. This approach flattens nuance and imposes an all-or-nothing decision on a diverse set of funding priorities.\n\nI also acknowledge the existence of the three founding entities that were allocated Genesis ADA that are working with different levels of success to improve Cardano according to their original missions. Some of these missions have been nominally completed, some of these missions continue in their original form, some continue in a new form. I do not pretend to know all the nuances. \n\nStill I take that as a factor in my decision-making. Treasury funds should be used judiciously in complement and in awareness of the existence of the entities. \n\nThis vote against this Budget in its full size is based on:\n\n1. My participation in the DRep voting stage and the level of DRep participation as a whole;\n2. The level of support that some proposals received relative to others;\n3. The relative importance of certain proposals vs others and the quality of the teams and their dedication to Cardano’s mission;\n4. And the expectation that Catalyst will likely gain sufficient support (in this or future budget proposals) to continue to support smaller, experimental, or commercial projects.\n\nWhile spending from the Treasury is not new (Catalyst has done it before), this is the first major annual on-chain budget, and it sets a precedent.\n\nIn my view, the issue is not inflation within the Cardano economy — most ADA will not be used to buy NFTs or FTs. Nor is it simply about a slightly higher disinflation rate. The deeper issue is ADA devaluation due to external sell pressure. Most of the funded ADA will be exchanged for fiat (USD, EUR, etc.), not recycled internally. This adds downward pressure on ADA’s price.\n\nIt is a see-saw that has its quirks. \n\nIn a real-world economy, if you spend more to \"jumpstart\" the economy, face inflation if the supply of services and goods cannot meet demand. \n\nIn a still nascent blockchain economy, spending more essentially means converting the native token for fiat, and the result is devaluation. We are not exchanging ADA directly for Cardano economy goods and services, we are selling it into the real world. The ADA is not recycled internally. This adds downward pressure on ADA’s price.\n\nThis devaluation affects everyone:\n\n1. The most important funded projects\n2. The projects that were not funded\n3. The builders who didn’t ask for funding \n4. The ADA holders who fund all of it through opportunity cost\n\nOf course, that is unavoidable. Most of the ADA allocated will likely be converted to fiat (USD, EUR, etc.) to pay for services, not retained or reused within the ecosystem. This creates exchange rate pressure, weakening ADA’s value.\n\nThe question isn’t whether devaluation will occur — it will. The real question is: Where do we draw the line? Do all 39 proposals in this budget bring more value than the cost of the devaluation they collectively impose? Do we need to bundle them all in one YES/NO budget vote? I think No. \n\nWe are approving a large, externally-focused budget at a time when Cardano’s “blockchain economy” and governance mechanism is still immature and internally fragile.\n\nTreasury funds should primarily be focused on critical public goods in different forms. Especially if they are open source; support infrastructure, research, tools, even education, promotion of Cardano. This applies when the goods align with the long-term mission of Cardano as public infrastructure. Yes, there may be exceptions that emerge, but those exceptions are expensive — and others will pay for them.\n\nIf we overfund less impactful proposals, we risk undermining the impact of the most critical ones, simply by diluting the value of what they are paid in.\n\nFor this reason, I believe a smaller, phased budget focused tightly on foundational public goods would be a better and safer starting point.\n\nI include this rationale as an earnest view of the proposed budget action with the aim of contributing to the process by encouraging the submitter (Intersect) to take more factors into account."

          "title": "2025 Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Budget - 7.5M ₳ for community builders",
          "abstract": "The Cardano 2025 on-chain budget process introduces a constitutionally driven, community-led model for treasury allocation. ADA holders, through Delegated Representatives (DReps) and Constitutional Committee oversight, vote on funding proposals within a capped Net Change Limit of 350 million ADA. The process includes two stages: community signaling and a binding on-chain Info Action vote.\nIntersect, a member-based organization, facilitates the process by organizing submissions and offering domain expertise, while final decisions rest with the community. Intersect also serves as the administrator for the use of approved funds.\nCurrent metrics show 11.22B ADA delegated, with 3.92B cast in Ekklesia—72% participation of active voting power. Yet, several proposals advanced without meeting a basic 50 + 1 Lovelace% threshold (2.69B ADA), raising concerns about legitimacy and governance integrity.\nThis info action aim to help community builders to quickly get approval onchain while individually they might not have 100k ADA deposit readily available. We submit all proposals (except founding entity proposals) that have met the 2.69B threshold for inclusion. Without respecting the safeguards put in place within the Cardano Constitution, low-support proposals may continue to pass, risking public confidence within the entire budgetary process. \nThe 2025 budget process reflects Cardano’s Voltaire vision—but its long-term success depends on transparency and accountability aligned with the constitution.",
          "rationale": "The 2025 Cardano budget process is built to reconcile strategic planning with decentralized authority, ensuring that treasury allocations are community-driven, constitutionally sound, and economically sustainable. It emphasizes transparency, voting legitimacy, and fiscal restraint—all within the framework of the Cardano Constitution and Net Change Limit (NCL).\n\n---\n\n### 1. Proposal Submission & Consolidation\n\nThe process began with dual intake:\n\n- **Block Budgets** from Intersect’s seven working committees (technical, governance, marketing, etc.)\n- **Open Submissions** from any Cardano contributor, regardless of Intersect membership.\n\nAll submissions were standardized—detailing problem, benefit, roadmap alignment, and cost—to ensure fair and structured evaluation. Founding entities (Intersect, IOG, Cardano Foundation, Emurgo) were expected to submit **independent Info Actions** and were **not bundled** with the general budget. This ensures neutrality and reinforces that **this budget includes only community and committee proposals that met threshold—excluding those from founding entities**.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Community Signaling\n\nAn off-chain signaling phase enabled DReps and ADA holders to express preliminary support via GovTool and Ekklesia. Only proposals that achieved **more than 50% approval by voting power** (a minimum of **2.69 billion ADA**, or 50%+1 Lovelace of the 5.38B active voting stake) were advanced to the *Budget Info Action*.\n\nEkklesia recorded just **3.92B in voting participation**, raising concerns that **proposals receiving less than 2.69B ADA in support—but still included—would not represent majority consensus**. This budget seeks to correct that by **excluding all proposals that failed to meet the full quorum** and by **removing founding entity proposals**, even if they surpassed the threshold. This aims to address prior practices resembling **voter engineering or gerrymandering**, where under-supported proposals were pushed through by bundling or procedural manipulation.\n\n---\n\n### 3. On-Chain Budget Approval (Budget Info Action)\n\nProposals that passed community signaling with >2.69B ADA were packaged into this *Budget Info Action* for on-chain ratification. In accordance with **Article IV of the Cardano Constitution**, a valid budget requires:\n\n- A **DRep vote surpassing 50%+1 Lovelace of active voting power** (≥2.69B ADA)\n- A **minimum of 5 out of 7 Constitutional Committee votes** affirming that the budget complies with the Constitution\n- All treasury disbursements to remain **within the 2025 Net Change Limit** (350 million ADA)\n\n---\n\nThis *Budget Info Action* complies with all of the above. DReps now vote knowing that **only proposals that passed the threshold and are constitutionally sound are included**.",
          "motivation": "The 2025 Cardano budget, established through the Intersect-led process, is designed to ensure Cardano remains secure, competitive, and growth-oriented during this pivotal first year of decentralized, constitutional governance. The total treasury allocation adheres to the community-approved Net Change Limit (NCL) of ₳350 million ada, reflecting our shared commitment to long-term financial sustainability.\nA key issue in the initial budget process was the misapplication of the participation threshold. The 50% + 1 Lovelace threshold was calculated based on total ada participating in the vote, rather than the active voting stake—which significantly alters the democratic weight of participating DReps.

        "abstract": "The Cardano 2025 on-chain budget process introduces a constitutionally driven, community-led model for treasury allocation. ADA holders, through Delegated Representatives (DReps) and Constitutional Committee oversight, vote on funding proposals within a capped Net Change Limit of 350 million ADA. The process includes two stages: community signaling and a binding on-chain Info Action vote.\nIntersect, a member-based organization, facilitates the process by organizing submissions and offering domain expertise, while final decisions rest with the community. Intersect also serves as the administrator for the use of approved funds.\nCurrent metrics show 11.22B ADA delegated, with 3.92B cast in Ekklesia—72% participation of active voting power. Yet, several proposals advanced without meeting a basic 50 + 1 Lovelace% threshold (2.69B ADA), raising concerns about legitimacy and governance integrity.\nThis info action aim to help community builders to quickly get approval onchain while individually they might not have 100k ADA deposit readily available. We submit all proposals (except founding entity proposals) that have met the 2.69B threshold for inclusion. Without respecting the safeguards put in place within the Cardano Constitution, low-support proposals may continue to pass, risking public confidence within the entire budgetary process. \nThe 2025 budget process reflects Cardano’s Voltaire vision—but its long-term success depends on transparency and accountability aligned with the constitution.",

        "rationale": "The 2025 Cardano budget process is built to reconcile strategic planning with decentralized authority, ensuring that treasury allocations are community-driven, constitutionally sound, and economically sustainable. It emphasizes transparency, voting legitimacy, and fiscal restraint—all within the framework of the Cardano Constitution and Net Change Limit (NCL).\n\n---\n\n### 1. Proposal Submission & Consolidation\n\nThe process began with dual intake:\n\n- **Block Budgets** from Intersect’s seven working committees (technical, governance, marketing, etc.)\n- **Open Submissions** from any Cardano contributor, regardless of Intersect membership.\n\nAll submissions were standardized—detailing problem, benefit, roadmap alignment, and cost—to ensure fair and structured evaluation. Founding entities (Intersect, IOG, Cardano Foundation, Emurgo) were expected to submit **independent Info Actions** and were **not bundled** with the general budget. This ensures neutrality and reinforces that **this budget includes only community and committee proposals that met threshold—excluding those from founding entities**.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Community Signaling\n\nAn off-chain signaling phase enabled DReps and ADA holders to express preliminary support via GovTool and Ekklesia. Only proposals that achieved **more than 50% approval by voting power** (a minimum of **2.69 billion ADA**, or 50%+1 Lovelace of the 5.38B active voting stake) were advanced to the *Budget Info Action*.\n\nEkklesia recorded just **3.92B in voting participation**, raising concerns that **proposals receiving less than 2.69B ADA in support—but still included—would not represent majority consensus**. This budget seeks to correct that by **excluding all proposals that failed to meet the full quorum** and by **removing founding entity proposals**, even if they surpassed the threshold. This aims to address prior practices resembling **voter engineering or gerrymandering**, where under-supported proposals were pushed through by bundling or procedural manipulation.\n\n---\n\n### 3. On-Chain Budget Approval (Budget Info Action)\n\nProposals that passed community signaling with >2.69B ADA were packaged into this *Budget Info Action* for on-chain ratification. In accordance with **Article IV of the Cardano Constitution**, a valid budget requires:\n\n- A **DRep vote surpassing 50%+1 Lovelace of active voting power** (≥2.69B ADA)\n- A **minimum of 5 out of 7 Constitutional Committee votes** affirming that the budget complies with the Constitution\n- All treasury disbursements to remain **within the 2025 Net Change Limit** (350 million ADA)\n\n---\n\nThis *Budget Info Action* complies with all of the above. DReps now vote knowing that **only proposals that passed the threshold and are constitutionally sound are included**.",

        "motivation": "The 2025 Cardano budget, established through the Intersect-led process, is designed to ensure Cardano remains secure, competitive, and growth-oriented during this pivotal first year of decentralized, constitutional governance. The total treasury allocation adheres to the community-approved Net Change Limit (NCL) of ₳350 million ada, reflecting our shared commitment to long-term financial sustainability.\nA key issue in the initial budget process was the misapplication of the participation threshold. The 50% + 1 Lovelace threshold was calculated based on total ada participating in the vote, rather than the active voting stake—which significantly alters the democratic weight of participating DReps. This discrepancy risks enabling governance distortion through low-turnout manipulation, akin to gerrymandering.\nTo safeguard against such vulnerabilities and uphold the integrity of Cardano’s governance process, this Info Action includes only those proposals submitted by community builders (that might not have 100k ADA deposit) and met the corrected threshold of 2.69B ada, equivalent to 50% + 1 Lovelace of the active registered voting stake. This ensures that community-driven proposals with broad support are prioritized.\nWe invite the founding entities to formally submit their respective budget proposals for community approval through the same transparent and constitutional mechanisms.

          "text": "🔥 #Cardano 治理更新 🔥\n\nCardano 的未来攸关什么：更新、宪法、财政库和预算。\n\nPlomin Hard Fork \n\n此更新将是全面参与 Cardano 治理的最后一步，该治理按照 CIP-1694 设计。预计 Plomin Hard Fork 很快就会在链上提交。几个月前，当 Chang Hard Fork 实施时，它激活了 Governance Bootstrap Phase，允许 Delegated Representatives (DReps) 在链上注册，并成立了 Constitutional Committee (CC)，与 Stake Pool Operators (SPOs) 一起对 Governance Actions (GAs) 进行投票。然而，治理是有限的。\n\n一旦 Plomin Hard Fork 通过，DReps 将获得完整的投票权，而不仅仅是能够对 Info Actions 进行投票（访问 https://t.co/aRWErA7Waj 获取不同类型 Governance Actions 的指南）。这意味着 Cardano Community 将能够更新 Cardano Constitution 并从 Cardano Treasury 中提取资金。\n\n我们为什么关心建立宪法和从财政库中提取资金？坦白地说，这是因为 Cardano 已经成长起来，我们现在必须开始独立生活了。当 Cardano 于 2017 年启动时，创始实体获得了 Ada 的资助（约占总供应量的 20%），以便为我们提供一个我们用户可以自我治理的去中心化生态系统。现在我们拥有了治理的权力，我们需要坚定地制定基本规则，以保护在 Cardano 生态系统中互动的每个人的权利，我们需要共同决定 Cardano 未来的发展路线图，并且我们需要有办法为此付费！\n\n宪法\n\n过去几个月对 Cardano 来说是历史性的时刻，社区参与了起草新宪法的审议过程。虽然 Chang Hard Fork 建立了一部 Interim Constitution，但该文件在编写时就带有明确的替换计划。@IntersectMBO 在 @InputOutputHK、@Cardano_CF、@emurgo_io 和无数社区贡献者的帮助下，在全球举办了 63 场研讨会，从中选出了 Constitutional Convention 的 Delegates。这些 Delegates 参与了综合会议，审查由 Intersect 的 Cardano Civics Committee 起草的新宪法提案的语言，征求了社区对拟议变更的反馈，然后齐聚 Buenos Aires 和 Nairobi 进行辩论并批准了最终草案。\n\n话虽如此，这部新宪法尚未获得批准！在像 Cardano 这样的区块链技术的去中心化生态系统中，新宪法的建立必须得到由其 DReps 代表的 Ada持有者投票赞成后才能生效。一旦 Plomin Hard Fork 通过（祈祷！），社区将能够考虑一项 Governance Action 来批准新宪法。如果必须，我们可以继续在 Interim Constitution下运作，但尽快转向一部源于社区审查过程的新宪法将是更可取的。\n\n财政库\n\nCardano 最独特和最强大的方面之一是我们拥有一个共同的财政库，用于支持区块链生态系统的运营、维护和未来发展。每个 Epoch，Rewards Pool 的 20%（交易费和货币扩张）将进入财政库，其余部分则用于 Staking Rewards。\n\n由于这个财政库来自本应属于 Cardano Community 成员的 Staking Rewards，因此必须确保资金的安全。这就是为什么 Interim Constitution 和拟议的宪法都规定，在进行任何 Treasury Withdrawals 之前，必须通过 Governance Info Action 批准 Net Change Limit。\n\n社区采用的 Net Change Limit 必须明确规定在一定时间内可以从财政库中支出多少 Ada。出于实际目的（至少在我们开始时），这很可能意味着我们决定在 73 个 Epoch（一个日历年）内支出多少。由于 CC 有义务否决任何不符合既定 Net Change Limit 的 Treasury Withdrawal GA，我们必须确保这个数值符合我们当年的计划支出，并考虑到可能出现的意外情况。这需要取得微妙的平衡！\n\n预算\n\n除了 Net Change Limit 之外，Interim Constitution 和拟议的宪法都规定，任何 Treasury Withdrawal GA 都不能通过，除非它符合经 Cardano 社区通过 DReps 投票批准的预算。CC 还必须对任何拟议的预算进行投票，以确保拟议的支出不违反宪法。\n\n宪法文本中的预算要求是特意灵活制定的，以便为 Cardano Community 提供资助去中心化生态系统的选项。虽然 Interim Constitution 只是说必须有某个预算存在，但拟议的宪法在描述每个预算如何必须有一个 Administrator 以确保 Treasury Withdrawals 被正确使用方面则更为明确。这个 Administrator 可以是个人、机构或智能合约，我预计这种做法会随着时间的推移而演变。\n\n虽然 Cardano 上的任何人都可以提议预算，但大量的社区努力一直集中在与 @IntersectMBO 合作，为 2025 年支持 Cardano 提出一份全面的预算。这个过程已接近完成，Budget Committee 表示他们很快就会准备好向社区报告他们的提案。他们已经举行了多次社区会议，描述了过程并征求了反馈。\n\nIntersect 方法的关键之一是确保没有单个人负责资金管理。Intersect 将提议的预算会将 Administrator 的职责分配给由 Cardano 社区成员运营的 Intersect 的各个委员会。再次强调，我们正在寻求平衡去中心化的好处与承认授权人们为更大利益行事是推动进程向前发展的最佳方式。\n\n时间表与结论\n\n现在我们已经清楚 Cardano 需要做什么才能向前发展，我们可以讨论每个行动的时间安排。每次提出 Governance Action 时，Cardano 社区都有 6 个 Epoch（30 天）的时间对其进行投票，然后 GA 需要一个 Epoch 才能生效。虽然大多数行动可以提前通过（如果它们获得了必要的赞成票门槛），但最好保守估计投票将持续整个可能的时间长度。\n\n如果 Plomin Hard Fork GA 在 12 月 21 日（Cardano Epoch 529 开始时）提交，我们预计可能在 1 月 24 日（Epoch 536）生效。届时，且只有到那时，我们才能合理地提交宪法以供批准。财政库也将解锁，DReps 可以考虑 Treasury Withdrawal Governance Actions。\n\n虽然财政库将在 1 月 24 日解锁（前提是 Plomin Hard Fork GA 通过），但在 Net Change Limit 和至少一个预算获得批准之前，CC 不会批准 DReps 提取资金的任何行动。这意味着我们需要 DReps 和 CC 就 Governance Info Actions 进行投票以批准这些项目，然后才能提交任何 Treasury Withdrawals。\n\n幸运的是，由于 DReps 现在能够对 Info Actions 进行投票，我们不需要等待 Plomin Hard Fork 生效就可以开始这些讨论。社区可以在同一时间窗口内考虑并对 Hard Fork、Net Change Limit 和拟议的预算进行投票。我们有很多重要的问题需要解决，但我相信我们能够解决它们，并展示去中心化治理如何使一个 Top-10 Blockchain 生态系统不仅能够运作，而且能够蓬勃发展！\n\n如果你像我一样是区块链治理的爱好者，你可能在阅读这篇文章时一直在点头，并且一直参与其中。如果你刚刚接触这个领域并且已经读到这里，我希望你能加入我们，迈出旅程的下一个重要步骤。无论如何，假期好好休息一下，因为一月份对 Cardano 来说将是一个激动人心的时刻！",

          "originalText": "🔥 #Cardano Governance Update 🔥\n\nWhat's at stake for the future of Cardano: The Update, The Constitution, the Treasury, and the Budgets.\n\nThe Plomin Hard Fork \n\nThis update will be the final step to full participation in Cardano Governance as designed by CIP-1694. Expect to see the Plomin Hard Fork submitted on chain very soon.  A few months ago, when the Chang Hard Fork was enacted, it activated the Governance Bootstrap Phase which allowed Delegated Representatives (DReps) to register on-chain and established the Constitutional Committee (CC) to vote on Governance Actions (GAs) along with Stake Pool Operators (SPOs).  However, governance was limited.\n\nOnce the Plomin Hard Fork passes the DReps will gain full voting power, not just the ability to vote on Info Actions (visit https://t.co/aRWErA7Waj for a guide to the different type of Governance Actions).  This means that the Cardano Community will be able to update the Cardano Constitution and withdraw funds from the Cardano Treasury.\n\nWhy do we care about establishing the Constitution and withdrawing funds from the Treasury?  Well, quite frankly, it's because Cardano has grown up and we have to start living on our own now.  When Cardano was launched in 2017 the pioneering entities were given grants of Ada (about 20% of the total supply) in order to deliver us a decentralized ecosystem that the we, the users, could govern ourselves.  Now that we have the power of governance we need to firmly set the ground rules that protects the rights of everyone who interacts in the Cardano ecosystem, we need to collectively decide on the future development roadmap of Cardano, and we need to have a way to pay for it!\n\nThe Constitution\n\nThe past few months have been a historic time for Cardano as the community engaged in a deliberative process to draft a new Constitution.  While an Interim Constitution had been established with the Chang Hard Fork that document was written with an intentional plan for replacement.  @IntersectMBO with the help of @InputOutputHK, @Cardano_CF, @emurgo_io, and countless community contributors held 63 workshops across the world where Delegates for a Constitutional Convention were selected. These Delegates participated in synthesis sessions to review the language of the proposed new constitution that had been drafted by the Cardano Civics Committee of Intersect, solicited community feedback on proposed changes, and then came together in Buenos Aires and Nairobi to debate and approve a final draft.\n\nAll that being said, this new Constitution is not yet approved!  In a decentralized ecosystem of blockchain technology like Cardano, the establishment of a new Constitution cannot be valid until the Ada holders, as represented by their DReps, vote in favor.  Once the Plomin Hard Fork has passed (fingers crossed!) the community will be able to consider a Governance Action to ratify the new Constitution.  We can continue to operate under the Interim Constitution, if we must, but it would be far preferable to move to a new Constitution that came from a community review process as soon as possible.\n\nThe Treasury\n\nOne of the most unique and powerful aspects of Cardano is that we have a common Treasury to provide for the operation, maintenance, and future development of the blockchain ecosystem. Each Epoch, 20% of the Rewards Pool (transaction fees and monetary expansion) goes to the Treasury instead while the rest goes to Staking Rewards.\n\nBecause this Treasury comes out of the Staking Rewards that would otherwise go to the members of the Cardano Community, it is essential that the fund be safeguarded.  That is why the Interim Constitution and the proposed Constitution both specify that a Net Change Limit must be approved through a Governance Info Action before any Treasury Withdrawals are made.\n\nThe Net Change Limit that is adopted by the community must define how much Ada can be spent out of the Treasury in a certain amount of time.  For practical purposes (at least as we start), this will most likely mean that we decide how much to spend in 73 epochs (a calendar year).  Because the CC is obligated to vote down any Treasury Withdrawal GA that does not fit within the established Net Change Limit, we must make sure that this value fits within our planned spending for the year and allows for contingencies that may come up.  There is a fine balance to be struck!\n\nThe Budgets\n\nIn addition to the Net Change Limit, the Interim Constitution and the proposed Constitution specify that the no Treasury Withdrawal GA can pass unless it fits within a Budget that has been approved by the Cardano community through a vote by DReps.  The CC must also vote on any proposed budget to ensure that proposed spending does not violate the Constitution.\n\nWith text of the Constitution, the Budget requirements are purposefully flexible to give the Cardano Community options to fund the decentralized ecosystem.  While the Interim Constitution simply says there must be some Budget in place, the proposed Constitution is a bit more explicit in describing how each Budget must have an Administrator to ensure Treasury Withdrawals are properly spent.  This Administrator could be a person, an institution, or a smart contract, and I expect we will see this practice evolve over time.\n\nWhile anyone on Cardano can propose a budget, a large amount of community effort has been focused on working with @IntersectMBO to propose a comprehensive budget to support Cardano in 2025.  This process is nearing completion and the Budget Committee has stated they will be ready to report their proposal to the community soon.  They have already held numerous community meetings describing the process and soliciting feedback.\n\nOne of the keys to Intersect's approach will be to ensure that there is no single person in charge of the administration of funds.  The Budgets that Intersect will propose will give Administrator responsibilities to various committees of Intersect that are run by Cardano community members.  Again, we are seeking to balance the benefits of decentralization with the recognition that empowering people to act for the greater good is the best way to move a process forward.\n\nThe Timeline & Conclusion\n\nNow that we have a clear picture on what needs to happen for Cardano to move forward, we can discuss the timing of each action. Each time a Governance Action is proposed the Cardano community has 6 Epochs (30 days) to vote on it and then it takes one Epoch for the GA to take effect.  While most actions can pass early (if they get the necessary threshold of Yes votes) it is best to make a conservative estimate that the vote will run the full length of time possible.\n\nIf the Plomin Hard Fork GA is submitted on December 21 (the beginning of Cardano Epoch 529) we are looking at probable enactment on January 24 (Epoch 536).  Then, and only then, can we reasonably submit the Constitution for ratification.  The Treasury will also be unlocked and DReps can consider Treasury Withdrawal Governance Actions.\n\nWhile the Treasury will be unlocked on January 24, provided that the Plomin Hard Fork GA passes, the CC will not approve any actions the DReps take to withdraw funds unless the Net Change Limit and at least one Budget have been approved.  That means that we will need to have the DReps and CC vote on Governance Info Actions to approve these items before any Treasury Withdrawals are submitted.\n\nFortunately, because DReps are able to vote for Info Actions right now, we do not need to wait for the Plomin Hard Fork to be enacted to begin these discussions.  The community can consider and vote on the Hard Fork, the Net Change Limit, and the proposed Budgets within the same window of time.  We have a lot of important issues to figure out but I am confident that we can work through them and show how decentralized governance can make a Top-10 Blockchain ecosystem not just function but thrive!\n\nIf you're a Blockchain Governance nerd like me, you've probably been nodding along as you read this and have been along for the ride up to this point.  If you're just getting into it and have read this far, I hope you'll join us for the next big step of the journey.  Either way, get some rest over the holidays, because January is going to be an exciting time for Cardano!"

          "originalText": "Draft budget proposals are out (although you knew that already)!\n\nOver the past three months, more than 100 members across our committees and working groups have been collaborating on ideas and proposals to advance Cardano. Now that we’re in phase two of the consultation period, the Cardano Budget Committee is sharing these preliminary proposals for broader input.\n\nYour feedback will help refine these drafts before they go to DReps and the ICC, ultimately improving on-chain outcomes.\n\n1⃣ Phase two discussion (4+ Weeks):\nWe’ll be discussing the proposals in the Cardano Forum, X Spaces, virtual meetings, and other community platforms. The Cardano Forum will be the center stage for feedback!\n\n2⃣ After approximately four weeks of discussion—depending on community feedback—we’ll move specific proposals to GovTool’s Proposal Discussion section to finalize metadata and enable polls and comments. Once consensus or strong momentum emerges, the proposals can be submitted on-chain for DReps and the ICC to consider.\n\n3⃣ Net-Change-Limit governance action:\nThe Net-Change-Limit, which determines how much can be drawn from the Treasury in a given period, might be submitted earlier if broad agreement forms around its value and metadata.\n\nIn general, we anticipate between four-eight weeks of off-chain collaboration, but this may be extended for further refinements—or accelerated if there’s strong community support.\n\nContribute!\n\nIf you’d like to get involved, please visit the Cardano Forum (special thanks to @Cardano_CF for their support) and add your thoughts and suggestions here ➡️ https://t.co/MNkzi50n7j\n\nAll shared documents are drafts and very much works in progress. The Budget Committee will keep everyone updated on progress and sentiment across proposals.\n\nThank you to everyone—especially our members—for dedicating your time and insight to getting us to this point. Let's get reviewing!"

By voting, DReps will shape the ecosystem’s trajectory while directly informing current and future budget discussions.\n\nAs the budget process advances, the outcome will ensure development efforts align with community consensus, guiding resource allocation to maximize impact.

If Cardano was a person and the funds were his savings, this is like blowing your money on partying. \n\nBut they are only a drop in the bucket as compared to the top 4 proposals, which make about 275m $ADA  \n\nI feel like i can fund building a new chain with 275m $ADA what exactly are we still missing on Cardano that we need to spend that amount in 1 year?\n\nSo looking at this, i would approve a Net Change Limit of 150m max.

We’re in a historical transition.\n\nOur responsibility is to document this process—its flaws, its breakthroughs, and everything in between—so that what we leave behind is a legacy, not just a result.\n\nIn this way, our mistakes and successes both become tools for future growth.\n\n🔁 I believe the Cardano ecosystem must thrive through free and open competition.\n\nFor that to happen, any proposal or authority must be evaluated and, if necessary, challenged openly.\n\nAnd that starts with us—with the community choosing to observe, report, and remember.\n\nCardano will evolve through our collective will and action.\n\nLet’s build something we can be proud to pass on.\nLet me know if you’d like this adapted for a Twitter/X thread or shortened for another format!"

          "originalText": "Maybe rather than tweeting about treasury spending at a high level, I can clarify what some of the spending is that I would actually vote YES for on-chain currently (ie not via off-chain processes, which I’m not a fan of), if asked to do so.\n\nAs always, please delegate to someone else if my approach is not in line with yours:\n\nNCL\nA reasonable NCL would in my mind ideally be below 150m, but to be pragmatic I’m willing to sign off on <= 200m. My reasons for this are well documented, but primarily relate to the emissions-price pressure-value add relationships.\n\nCore dev\nA reasonable proposal by IOG to keep delivering on critical roadmap items would get my instant support. In my view the one we have seen on gov tools ticks that box, if with a slightly hefty ask. Also assuming no surprises, I’d approve associated forks and changes. \n\nI am aware others besides IOG could do some of the work, but I think a safe approach in the first years of governance would be to only gradually diversify the work beyond IOG, rather than pull away from them immediately. Again, being conservative.\n\nHigh impact cost efficient proposals\nCost efficient, high impact technology efforts by other, ideally proven, actors. Think Midgard, Starstream or alternative nodes for single digit millions of ADA. Willing to entertain all similar impact and cost efficient ones.\n\nOrgs\nAssorted spending for Intersect and similar orgs pushing Cardano forward, if the asks are reasonable and well documented / detailed. Smaller asks will naturally be an easier yes.\n\nCatalyst and/or Intersect budget\nA slimmed down version of Catalyst to capture a lot of the efforts others want to put forward. Catalyst is a system that is not perfect, but is improving (eg quadratic voting) and is the current best framework we have for such things. Intersect might complement this, but needs to prove itself.\n\nSummary\nThis covers core tech, non core tech innovation, orgs and all the other proposals via Intersect/Catalyst.\n\nI think at a high level it should in principle be possible to fit all the above into a NCL of 150m ADA, though that would require some frugality on the part of all participants.\n\nMy stance on governance is that it should be transparent and on-chain wherever possible. I am currently unsure whether the Intersect budget process is as robust as what we have in place with Catalyst, and in any case it would need to prove itself.\n\nTherefore my preference would be to pull some of the tech related ones that I mentioned out of this process, and put them to a direct DRep vote fairly soon. Shrink down both Catalyst/Intersect budgets significantly and put them to a vote. I’ll likely support them."

          "text": "关于净变化限额和预算提案\n\n作为一名 DRep，我对有关净变化限额 (NCL) 的两项治理行动 (GA) 都投了赞成票。\n\n现阶段看来，第二项 GA 将获得批准，将 NCL 设定为 3.5 亿 ADA。\n\n根据我的民意调查反馈，社区中有相当一部分人认为这个数字过高。 \n\n一些 DReps 现在正将其最初的赞成票改为反对票。\n\n在正在进行的关于是否批准第二项有关 NCL 的 GA 的民意调查中，结果是各占一半。\n\n我将维持我的赞成立场，并将概述原因。\n\n现在已接近四月底，但批准的 NCL 仍悬而未决。  生态系统迫切需要资金分配以资助发展计划。  进一步拖延等待另一个 GA 周期将适得其反。 \n\n重要的是要考虑到许多 DReps 倾向于在最后阶段投票，而 GA 批准通常需要大约六个时期（约一个月）。 \n\n如果这项提案获得批准，财政资金的支付最早可能在五月或六月开始。  希望如此！\n\n是的，高 NCL 存在风险——它增加了财政大幅提取的可能性。\n\n同样值得强调的是，DReps 有权批准远低于既定 NCL 的支出。 \n\n社区中有些声音警告说，总支出可能会接近 NCL，仿佛这是一个必然的结果。  在我看来，这听起来更像是世界末日的景象，而不是现实的预测。 \n\n责任最终在于 DReps。  如果每项资金决策都根据其自身的价值进行评估，那么这种超支是可以——也应该——避免的。\n\n我将支持一项提议较低 NCL 的新 GA，大约在 2 亿到 2.5 亿 ADA 之间。  我很可能会对此投赞成票。\n\n我知道存在一些大型 DRep（包括一个创始实体）立场非常强硬，可能会拒绝批准较低 NCL 的风险。\n\n我目前正在审查预算提案，并确定了大约 20 项我倾向于支持的提案。\n\n最初，我假设 1.5 亿 ADA 足以作为我个人的 NCL 阈值。 \n\n然而，IOG 约 9700 万 ADA 的请求和 Catalyst 约 7000 万 ADA 的请求迫使我提高这一估计。 \n\n我倾向于暂时不设定固定限额，因为新的提案不断涌现。  不过，我的目标是支持低于 2.5 亿 ADA 的总体 NCL。 \n\n我真的希望我能将其控制在 2 亿 ADA 左右。 \n\n我仍然强烈倾向于 Catalyst 而非预算提案。\n\n为什么？ \n\n因为大多数 DReps 表示愿意每月只花一天时间参与治理。 \n\n目前，有 150 项提案，总计要求 4.8 亿 ADA。 \n\n依赖那些可能在每项提案上只花几分钟时间的人做决策是危险的。  有些提案可能完全被忽视。这是不负责任的。 \n\n我的策略保持不变：我将只支持少数几个必要的预算提案以及 Catalyst。 \n\n大多数项目应该通过 Catalyst 寻求资金。\n\nCatalyst 提供了几个明显的优势：\n\n• 一个经过多年成熟的框架。\n\n• 团队熟悉其流程。\n\n• 每轮的资金上限引入了一定程度的财政纪律。\n\n• DReps 可以参与社区审查并指导 ADA 持有者如何投票。\n\n相比之下，预算提案系统完全未经检验，其背后的团队也基本上不为人所知。 \n\n此外，Intersect 需要高昂的运营成本。\n\n将数亿 ADA 分配给一个未经证实的系统几乎没有意义。\n\n这种机制应该首先用有限的资金进行测试。  如果成功，才可以委托其管理更大份额的财政资源。\n\n有趣的是，我的民意调查显示，虽然人们倾向于预算提案，但对 Catalyst 的支持依然存在。 \n\n一些受访者对这两种机制都不信任。\n\n我每天都会关注治理进展，并根据需要进行调整。 \n\n如果我最终决定将我的 NCL 投票改为“否”，我会及时通知。  截至目前，我没有这样的打算。\n\n感谢大家的反馈。\n\n我的 DRep ID：\ndrep1km69g7ksf8t5g0h9d9tkrcd2tezxelx0wtr76rv2mrkl5nzd6v3 ",

          "originalText": "On the Net Change Limit and Budget Proposals\n\nAs a DRep, I cast a YES vote to approve both governance actions (GA) concerning the Net Change Limit (NCL).\n\nAt this stage, it appears the second GA will be ratified, setting the NCL at 350M ADA.\n\nBased on feedback from my poll, a substantial portion of the community views this figure as excessive. \n\nSome DReps are now switching their original YES vote to NO.\n\nIn the ongoing poll on whether to approve the second GA regarding NCL or not, the result is half and half.\n\nI will maintain my YES stance, and I’ll outline why.\n\nWe are nearing the end of April, yet an approved NCL is still pending. The ecosystem urgently needs capital allocation to fund development initiatives. Delaying further to wait for another GA cycle would be counterproductive.\n\nIt’s important to consider that many DReps tend to vote in the final stages, and GA ratification typically takes around six epochs (approximately one month). \n\nIf this proposal is ratified, disbursement from the Treasury could begin in May or June. Hopefully!\n\nYes, a high NCL carries risk—it increases the likelihood of aggressive Treasury drawdowns.\n\nIt’s also worth emphasizing that DReps have the authority to approve spending far below the defined NCL. \n\nSome voices in the community warn that total expenditures might approach NCL, as if this were a guaranteed outcome. To me, that sounds like a doomsday scenario rather than a realistic forecast. \n\nThe responsibility ultimately lies with the DReps. If each funding decision is evaluated on its individual merits, such overspending can—and should—be avoided.\n\nI would support a new GA that proposes a lower NCL, somewhere between 200M and 250M ADA. I would likely vote YES for that.\n\nI am aware of the risk that a few big DReps, including one founding entity, have a very strong position and may refuse to approve a lower NCL.\n\nI am currently reviewing Budget Proposals and have identified around 20 of them that I am inclined to support.\n\nInitially, I assumed that 150M ADA would suffice as my personal NCL threshold. \n\nHowever, IOG’s request for ~97M ADA and Catalyst’s request for ~70M ADA compel me to raise that estimate. \n\nI prefer not to set a fixed limit yet, as new proposals continue to surface. Still, I aim to support an overall NCL below 250M ADA. \n\nI really hope I manage to keep it around 200M ADA.\n\nMy preference continues to lean strongly toward Catalyst over Budget Proposals.\n\nWhy? \n\nBecause most DReps have indicated a willingness to dedicate just one day per month to governance. \n\nAt present, there are 150 proposals requesting a total of 480M ADA. \n\nIt is dangerous to rely on decision-making by individuals who may spend just a few minutes per proposal. Some proposals may be overlooked entirely. That’s irresponsible.\n\nMy strategy remains unchanged: I will back only a few essential Budget Proposals alongside Catalyst. \n\nMost projects should seek funding through Catalyst.\n\nCatalyst offers several clear advantages:\n\n• A framework that has matured over the years.\n\n• Teams are familiar with their processes.\n\n• Funding caps per round introduce a level of fiscal discipline.\n\n• DReps can participate in community reviews and guide ADA holders on how to vote.\n\nBy contrast, the Budget Proposals system is completely untested, and the team behind it remains largely unknown. \n\nMoreover, Intersect requires a high operational cost.\n\nIt makes little sense to allocate hundreds of millions of ADA to a system that hasn't been proven.\n\nThis mechanism should be tested first, with limited funds. If successful, it could then be entrusted with a larger portion of Treasury resources.\n\nInterestingly, my poll shows that while there is a preference for Budget Proposals, support for Catalyst remains. \n\nSome respondents distrust both mechanisms.\n\nI monitor governance developments daily and will adapt as needed. \n\nIf I ultimately decide to change my NCL vote to NO, I’ll communicate that promptly. As of now, I have no such intention.\n\nThank you all for the feedback.\n\nMy DRep ID:\ndrep1km69g7ksf8t5g0h9d9tkrcd2tezxelx0wtr76rv2mrkl5nzd6v3"

          "originalText": "I appreciate the transparency. I have a few follow-up questions:\n\n1. Why was the decision made to only count the participating stake when calculating the approval threshold? Thereby deviating from the on-chain governance process.\n2. What happens if the approved proposals exceed the NCL?\n3. Will there only be two budget info actions submitted by Intersect?\n4. When will the budget info actions be submitted?\n5. Why is the first reconciliation Workshop 1 day longer?\n\nIn my opinion, the decision to count only participating stake, meaning only counting the voting power of DReps that vote yes or no, is too low of a threshold, especially since the voting phase is only two days.\n\nThere is a reason why non-participating stake behaves like a NO vote for all governance actions.\n\nIMHO only including participating stake and having a short voting window will make it too easy to be included. \n\nSome proposals will only be submitted tomorrow (April 24th), so there is not enough time to review them.\n\nTL;DR only considering participating stake with such a short voting period is a mistake that will decrease the legitimacy of the budget info actions"

          "originalText": "My Rationale for Budget Proposals\n\nI supported 23 projects totaling 222.2M ADA. I voted NO for all others.\n\nNumber of supported projects across categories:\n\n• Core: 17\n• Research: 2\n• Marketing & Innovation: 2\n• Governance support: 2\n\nThe 3 largest projects I supported are IOG Core development, IO Research, and Catalyst. \n\nThese 3 items account for 193M ADA.\n\nI was hesitant to support IOG research. In the past, many academic papers have been published. We do not need all the research items on the list for next year. Now it is necessary to support implementation and the ecosystem more, which, in my opinion, is lagging behind research.\n\nOn the other hand, Cardano's success is largely based on research and quality implementation using formal methods. \n\nNot supporting research would be a step aside. Some of the things on the list may be implemented in the future.\n\nMy recommendation for next time is to create a separate proposal for each item instead of one proposal with many items. This also applies to Core development.\n\nAs I mentioned before, I consider Catalyst to be the place where most projects should apply for funding. That is why I support it.\n\nDuring the review of Budget Proposals, I noticed that in many cases, only about 2-3 DReps voted. In the best case, about 10, rarely around 20. This is a very low participation.\n\nCatalyst is not perfect, but it has been improved for several years, the team is experienced, and it is a battle-tested tool. ADA holders are already familiar with the system. Moreover, further improvements are planned.\n\nAt this point, I see no reason to replace Catalyst with Budget Proposals.\n\nMy other recommendation is that IOG should submit separate GAs for their proposals once the NCL is approved. This will avoid the situation where DReps vote on a GA with many other items in one GA.\n\nI only used 29M ADA to support the other 23 projects. \n\nThese are projects that, in my opinion, the ecosystem desperately needs.\n\nI consider Midgard, Starstream, Hydra, ZK Rollups, an alternative Cardano node, integration with Bitcoin, and several others to be must-have projects.\n\nIf I came across multiple similar proposals, I preferred open-source projects and entities that are well-known to the community or have delivered a project that is still in use today.\n\nI would like to emphasize that if I voted NO, it could mean:\n\n• I don't like the project. It shouldn't be funded from Treasury (or Catalyst).\n\n• I like the project, and it should apply for funding from Catalyst.\n\nIn general, I think that projects with ambitions to be commercially successful should look for other sources of funding. \n\nI don't like it when a risky business is funded from the Treasury, and in case of success, the profit is privatized.\n\nIf projects apply for Treasury funding, they should have a strategy on how to return part of the profit back to the community in case of success.\n\nFurthermore, I think that if it is a startup, the team cannot expect that devs will be paid the same salaries as IOG devs. Part of the risk must be borne by the team, not just Treasury.\n\nSome projects do not have a commercial character, for example, libraries, dev tools, etc. We should identify these projects, evaluate their benefits, and possibly support them.\n\nThe last major project I supported was the Marketing Strategy from the Cardano Foundation. This also includes the Cardano Summit.\n\nIn general, I do not want to support projects from founding entities that hold Genesis coins and have not spent them yet. The Cardano Foundation is such an entity, which was negatively reflected in the last Catalyst Fund.\n\nOn the other hand, this proposal was the best in the marketing category. The Cardano Foundation supports many activities in the ecosystem. CF wants to remain active in the long term and support building the ecosystem, for which it needs to secure funding.\n\nThe costs of the Cardano Summit and other marketing activities can be high. I would not like to risk that if their proposal is not approved, the next Cardano Summit will not be organized. The crypto industry could perceive this negatively.\n\nI have only supported a single proposal from Intersect regarding the budget for open-source development. They are asking for 5.8M ADA.\n\nNew proposals appear every day, so my decision may not be final.  I may make changes.\n\nMy DRep ID:\ndrep1km69g7ksf8t5g0h9d9tkrcd2tezxelx0wtr76rv2mrkl5nzd6v3"

          "text": "我投票反对 ⛔️ 将净变化限额 (NCL) 降至 2 亿 ADA，这是迄今为止最艰难的治理决策之一。 \n\n感觉这里没有完全好的选择。\n\n此外，我自己也曾呼吁降低 NCL。\n\n目前 3.5 亿 ADA 的 NCL 有一些明显的缺点。\n\n如果巨大的抛售压力导致 ADA 价格大幅下跌，比如说跌至 0.2 美元，则可能导致严重的挑战。 \n\n以美元计价为生态系统提供资金将需要从国库中出售大量 ADA，从而导致抛售压力的螺旋式上升，从而使情况恶化。\n\nCardano Whale (@cardano_whale) 指出，像 Tezos 和 Polkadot 这样的一些项目在其生态系统中投入了大量资金，拥有创新技术，但仍难以获得实质性的关注。\n\n我完全同意这一点。\n\n对于区块链而言，保持在前十大市值排名中的地位至关重要。\n\n散户投资者、机构和加密货币爱好者不仅根据技术，还根据市场表现来评估项目。 \n\n如果 Cardano 长期跌出前十，无论其去中心化程度或像 Ouroboros Leios 这样的技术进步如何，它可能永远无法恢复其地位。 \n\n这是一个需要考虑的重要因素，即使它感觉不公平或主观。\n\n另一方面，将 NCL 降至 2 亿 ADA 也有其自身的担忧。\n\nCardano 需要投资来推进其技术、支持建设者并发展生态系统。  如果没有增加的用户活动，财政收入就不会增长。\n\n未来几年的维护和开发支出可能会耗尽储备金，最终使 Cardano 在经济上不可持续。\n\n协议安全性还取决于有吸引力的质押奖励和激励措施。  此外，如果没有活跃的开发人员、工具和不断发展的 DeFi 生态系统，Ouroboros Leios 的潜力将无法发挥。  所有这些领域的投资都至关重要。 \n\nIOG 已经明确了他们的资金需求：核心开发需要 9600 万 ADA，Catalyst 需要 6900 万 ADA，研究需要 2700 万 ADA。  总计 1.92 亿 ADA。IOG 的提议很简单：要么批准这笔资金，要么就算了。\n\n关于公平性、IOG 和 Charles 过去的贡献以及 Cardano“完成”的定义的争论自有其道理，但现实是 IOG 在协议方面拥有无与伦比的专业知识。  没有其他实体能够以同样的速度或质量有效地接管维护、开发和研究。\n\n如果 DReps 将 1.92 亿 ADA 分配给 IOG，那么其他项目只剩下 800 万 ADA。\n\n在审查了预算提案后，我只支持了我认为生态系统绝对需要的那些基本项目：像 Midgard、Starstream、Hydra、ZK Rollups、Blockfrost、Lucid、Chainlink 集成等等。 \n\n仅核心类别一项，就大约需要 1200 万 ADA。  在所有类别中，我批准的总预算为 2.13 亿 ADA。\n\n鉴于我自己估计所需支出为 2.13 亿 ADA，我不能支持 2 亿 ADA 的 NCL。 \n\n这将与我对必要项目资金的立场与我批准的上限相矛盾。  这种不一致性导致我决定投票反对降低 NCL。\n\nCardano 需要有效的市场营销和改进的治理支持，因为目前的情况远非理想。\n\n投资生态系统和推进新技术必须齐头并进，以确保可持续增长。\n\n在我看来，批准 2 亿 ADA 的 NCL 将意味着维持现状，将所有关键职责留给 IOG，同时忽视对更广泛生态系统的投资。 \n\n从本质上讲，这将限制对生态系统至关重要的实体的资金，就像 IOG 一样。\n\n一个重要的考虑因素是围绕 NCL 的预期情景。\n\n在我看来，3.5 亿 ADA 和 2 亿 ADA 的 NCL 都是极端的。\n\n目前的 NCL 定为 3.5 亿 ADA，得到了 76% 参与投票权益的有力支持。  几乎所有的投票权益都批准了它。将 NCL 从 3.5 亿大幅削减至 2 亿 ADA，要么是不负责任的，要么是过于雄心勃勃的。\n\n接下来会发生什么？  建设者、Intersect、IOG 或其他人可能会提交一项新的治理行动，提议一个中间的 NCL，也许是 2.5 亿或 3 亿 ADA。  或者，可以同时提交多个提案。 \n\n这种情况会造成一个不稳定的环境，这种环境是适得其反且难以支持的。  这种不稳定性会破坏进步。\n\n此外，加密社区对 Cardano 生态系统能够负担多少投资的冗长辩论兴趣不大。\n\n在不稳定的环境中，即使提出一个连贯的预算也几乎是不可能的。\n\n目前，我们的 NCL 为 3.5 亿 ADA。  考虑一下这个可能的情景：\n\nIntersect 预计将提交一项于六月到期的预算治理行动。  与此同时，如果到五月底批准了新的 2 亿 ADA NCL，那么除非在新的 NCL 生效前批准预算提案，否则该提案实际上将变得违宪。 \n\n这使过程复杂化，并进一步凸显了突然、极端变化带来的问题。 \n\n通过治理行动来辩论 NCL 既效率低下又过于耗时。\n\n社区的共识似乎很可能在 2.5 亿至 3 亿 ADA 之间。  然而，在链上投票之前没有进行链下温度检查（大多数社区会对此做出回应），这导致当前的 NCL 仅仅为了让预算过程得以继续而被批准。\n\nNCL 本身的概念开始让人觉得没有必要，因为它总是根据多数票而变化。  如果投票权益同意增加或减少 NCL，这必然会发生。\n\n重要的是要强调，NCL 并不决定必须从国库中支出的金额。  每项提款提案仍需社区批准。\n\n如果目前的提案在 2.5 亿至 3 亿 ADA 的范围内，我可能会投赞成票。  如果提交了这样的提案，我会支持它，因为它符合我认为基于我已认可的提案的合理预算。\n\n然而，我的决定并非最终决定，可能会根据未来治理方面的发展而改变。 \n\n例如，如果治理行动将多个提案合并导致总成本过高，或者如果 IOG 提案与我不支持的几个提案或我强烈反对的一个提案（例如 Daedalus 2025 服务增强提案）组合在一起，我可能会重新考虑我的立场。\n\n如果避免糟糕预算结果的唯一方法是投票支持较低的 NCL，我准备这样做。  这个决定是微妙的，不能非黑即白地看待。\n\n我希望避免出现批准较低 NCL 不可避免地导致另一次 GA 提交的情况。  反复处理 NCL 既耗时又没有成效。\n\nDReps 需要优先处理预算提案。\n\n如果最终资助的是低质量项目，那么较高的 NCL 就毫无意义。\n\n我的 DRep ID：\ndrep1km69g7ksf8t5g0h9d9tkrcd2tezxelx0wtr76rv2mrkl5nzd6v3 ",

          "originalText": "I voted NO ⛔️to reduce the Net Change Limit (NCL) to 200M ADA, which has been one of the toughest governance decisions so far. \n\nIt feels like there’s no entirely good option here.\n\nMoreover, I myself called for a lower NCL.\n\nThe current NCL of 350M ADA has some notable drawbacks.\n\nIf high selling pressure causes ADA’s price to drop significantly, say to 0.2 USD, it could result in serious challenges. \n\nFunding the ecosystem in dollar terms would require selling a large amount of ADA from the treasury, leading to a spiral of selling pressure that could worsen the situation.\n\nCardano Whale (@cardano_whale) pointed out that some projects like Tezos and Polkadot have invested heavily in their ecosystems, possess innovative technologies, yet struggle to gain substantial attention.\n\nI fully agree with that.\n\nFor blockchains, maintaining a presence in the top 10 market capitalization rankings is vital.\n\nRetail investors, institutions, and crypto enthusiasts evaluate projects not only based on technology but also on market performance. \n\nIf Cardano drops out of the top 10 for an extended period, it may never regain its position, regardless of decentralization or technological progress like Ouroboros Leios. \n\nThis is an important factor to consider, even if it feels unfair or subjective.\n\nOn the other hand, reducing the NCL to 200M ADA comes with its own set of concerns.\n\nCardano needs investments to advance its technology, support builders, and develop the ecosystem. Without increased user activity, Treasury revenue won't grow. \n\nSpending on maintenance and development in the next years risks exhausting the reserve, ultimately making Cardano economically unsustainable.\n\nProtocol security also hinges on attractive staking rewards and incentives. Moreover, Ouroboros Leios’s potential will remain untapped without active developers, tools, and a growing DeFi ecosystem. Investments in all these areas are crucial.\n\nIOG has made their funding requirements clear: Core Dev needs 96M ADA, Catalyst 69M ADA, and Research 27M ADA. Combined, this totals 192M ADA. The offer from IOG is simple: either approve this funding or let it be.\n\nDebates around fairness, IOG and Charles’s past contributions, and the definition of “completion” for Cardano have their place, but the reality is that IOG holds unmatched expertise in the protocol. No other entity can effectively take over maintenance, development, and research at the same pace or quality.\n\nIf DReps allocate 192M ADA to IOG, only 8M ADA remains for other projects.\n\nAfter reviewing budget proposals, I supported only the essentials I believe the ecosystem absolutely needs: projects like Midgard, Starstream, Hydra, ZK Rollups, Blockfrost, Lucid, Chainlink integration, and others. \n\nFor the CORE category alone, this amounts to around 12M ADA. Across all categories, my total approved budget comes to 213M ADA.\n\nGiven my own estimate of required expenditures is 213M ADA, I cannot support an NCL of 200M ADA. \n\nIt would contradict my stance on necessary project funding versus the cap I approve. This inconsistency guided my decision to vote NO on reducing the NCL.\n\nCardano requires effective marketing and improved governance support, as the current situation is far from ideal.\n\nInvesting in the ecosystem and advancing new technologies must go hand in hand to ensure sustainable growth.\n\nApproving the NCL of 200M ADA, in my view, would mean preserving the status quo, leaving all key responsibilities to IOG while neglecting investment in the broader ecosystem. \n\nEssentially, it would restrict funding for entities that are vital to the ecosystem, just as IOG is.\n\nAn important consideration is the expected scenarios surrounding the NCL.\n\nBoth NCLs, an NCL of 350M ADA and 200M ADA, are extremes in my view.\n\nThe current NCL, set at 350M ADA, has strong support with 76% of the voting stake participating. Nearly the entire voting stake approved it. Drastically reducing the NCL from 350M to 200M ADA would be either irresponsible or overly ambitious.\n\nWhat would happen next? Builders, Intersect, IOG, or others would likely submit a new governance action proposing an intermediate NCL, perhaps 250M or 300M ADA. Alternatively, multiple proposals could be submitted simultaneously.\n\nThis scenario would create an unstable environment that is counterproductive and difficult to support. Such instability undermines progress.\n\nMoreover, the crypto community has little interest in prolonged debates about how much the Cardano ecosystem can afford to invest.\n\nIn an unstable environment, even proposing a coherent budget becomes nearly impossible.\n\nCurrently, we have an NCL of 350M ADA. Consider this likely scenario:\n\nIntersect is expected to submit a governance action for the budget expiring in June. Meanwhile, if a new NCL of 200M ADA is approved by the end of May, the proposed budget would effectively become unconstitutional unless it is approved before the new NCL takes effect. \n\nThis complicates the process and further highlights the issues with sudden, extreme changes.\n\nDebating the NCL through governance actions is both inefficient and overly time-consuming.\n\nIt seems likely that the community's consensus would fall somewhere between 250M–300M ADA. However, no off-chain temperature check was conducted (to which the majority of the community would respond) before the on-chain vote, which led to the current NCL being approved simply to allow the budgeting process to continue.\n\nThe concept of the NCL itself is starting to feel unnecessary, as it constantly shifts based on the majority vote. If the voting stake agrees to increase or decrease the NCL, it will inevitably happen.\n\nIt’s important to emphasize that the NCL doesn’t dictate the amount that must be spent from the treasury. Every withdrawal proposal still requires approval from the community.\n\nI would likely vote YES if the current proposal fell within the 250M–300M ADA range. If a proposal like this is submitted, I would support it, as it aligns with the budget I consider reasonable based on the proposals I have endorsed.\n\nHowever, my decision isn’t final and may change depending on future developments in governance. \n\nFor instance, if governance actions combine multiple proposals that result in an excessively high total cost, or if the IOG proposal is grouped with several proposals I don’t support, or one I strongly oppose, such as the Daedalus 2025 Service Enhancement, I might reconsider my stance.\n\nIf the only way to prevent a poor budget outcome is to vote for a lower NCL, I am prepared to do so. This decision is nuanced and cannot be seen in black-and-white terms.\n\nI want to avoid a scenario where approving a lower NCL inevitably results in another GA submission. Addressing the NCL repeatedly is time-consuming and unproductive. \n\nDReps need to prioritize budget proposals instead.\n\nA higher NCL serves no purpose if it ends up funding low-quality projects within the budget.\n\nMy DRep ID:\ndrep1km69g7ksf8t5g0h9d9tkrcd2tezxelx0wtr76rv2mrkl5nzd6v3"

          "text": "IOG 目前提交的提案——涵盖核心开发、Catalyst 和研究——总共已申请 1.93 亿 ADA。  将 NCL 设定在 2 亿 ADA 将几乎耗尽限额，几乎没有空间资助其他关键基础设施提案。  这种情况可能会阻碍 Cardano 的增长。 \n\n从根本上说，NCL 并非旨在完全支出的预算，而是一个界定在特定时期内可提取最大金额的护栏。  由于我们仍处于向链上治理过渡的早期阶段，此时施加限制性上限可能会削弱有效决策和及时响应所需的灵活性。\n\n此外，NCL 一旦确立并非永久固定。  随着预算执行的进展以及市场条件的变化，它应该接受审查和调整。\n\n在这个过渡时期，审慎的做法是设计足够的余地以适应不确定性。  这样做将支持可持续和战略性的生态系统治理。\n\n#Cardano #ADA #Drep ",

          "originalText": "The proposals currently submitted by IOG — covering Core Development, Catalyst, and Research — already request a total of 193M ADA. Setting the NCL at 200M ADA would nearly exhaust the limit, leaving little room for funding other critical infrastructure proposals. This situation risks hindering Cardano’s growth.\n\nFundamentally, the NCL is not a budget intended to be fully spent, but rather a guardrail that defines the maximum amount that may be withdrawn within a given period. As we are still in the early stages of transitioning to on-chain governance, imposing a restrictive cap at this time could undermine the flexibility needed for effective decision-making and timely response.\n\nMoreover, the NCL is not fixed permanently once established. It should be subject to review and adjustment as budget execution progresses and as market conditions evolve.\n\nIn this transitional period, it is prudent to design with sufficient margin to accommodate uncertainty. Doing so will support sustainable and strategic ecosystem governance.\n\n#Cardano #ADA #Drep"

          "originalText": "📘【SIPO Report】Cardano 2025 Budget Proposals – Round 1 (as of May 5, 2025)\n\nThis is an overview of the 40 proposals that passed, along with insights and future considerations from SIPO as a DRep.\n\n🧮【Overview】\n\n• Number of Proposals Passed: 40\n• Average Support Rate: Generally above 75% (Highest: 99.13%)\n• Total Allocated Budget: Over 100M ADA (Top 5 account for more than 60% of total)\n👇\nhttps://t.co/dKBcLUByY9\n\n🔍【5 Notable Characteristics Among the Passed Proposals】\n\n① Strengthening of L1/L2 Technical Infrastructure\nMidgard (Optimistic Rollups) / Starstream / zkFold/ Hydra Hexcore / Scalus / OpShin / UTxO RPC / Pallas, etc.\n👉 These were recognized as critical components of Cardano 2.0’s scalability strategy.\n\n② Maintenance and Enhancement of Infrastructure & Tools\nBlockfrost / PyCardano / Lucid / Dolos / Gerolamo\nAdaStat / Cexplorer / Eternl / Ledger App Rewrite\n👉 Investments were focused on developer-facing infrastructure and trusted tooling.\n\n③ Governance & Institutional Development\nIntersect / Catalyst 2025 / Beyond MVG / Builder DAO\n👉 Emphasis was placed on frameworks and participation infrastructure to support the Voltaire era.\n\n④ Real World Assets (RWA) & DeFi Connectivity\nTokenized Real Estate\n👉 While proposed, most financial tokenization and liquidity integration efforts lacked sufficient support.\n\n⑤ Web3 Use Cases & Community Initiatives\nContract Layer for Bitcoin / Global Events Strategy / Ecosystem Pavilion\n👉 While basic events were funded, only one BTC×Cardano proposal passed. There was generally little investment in tangible “real-world Cardano use” projects.\n\n📈【Top 5 Funded Proposals by Budget Allocation】\n\n• IOG Core Engineering: ₳96.82M (L1 Infrastructure)\n• Catalyst 2025: ₳69.46M (Governance Infrastructure)\n• Intersect: ₳20M (Organizational/Institutional Infrastructure)\n• TWEAG Proposal Series: ₳11.07M (Implementation/Haskell)\n• Cardano Summit 2025: ₳6M (Outreach & Events)\n\n※ The top 5 proposals alone represent over 60% of the total allocated budget, showing a concentration of investment.\n\n🧭【Summary of Adoption Trends】\n\nThis round’s outcomes were concentrated along two main axes, with a strong emphasis on technical infrastructure:\n\n✅ Expansion of Cardano’s technical foundation\n✅ Support for governance systems and organizational infrastructure\n\nIn contrast, proposals focusing on:\n• Real-world use cases\n• RealFi, UX, and liquidity connectivity\n• DAO-based governance\n\n• Education, culture, and media expansion\n\n…were largely passed over. Especially real-world applicability and RealFi remain key areas for potential reevaluation in future rounds.\n\n📘【Comparison to SIPO Voting】\n\nSIPO YES votes: 82 proposals\n→ Passed: 40 proposals (approx. 49%)\n\nAmong SIPO’s three pillars—“Infrastructure + Real-World Implementation + Institutional Design”:\n\n→ Infrastructure-focused proposals aligned strongly with overall DRep consensus\n→ Institutional proposals had mixed results\n→ Real-world use case proposals were mostly deferred\n\n❌【Trends Among Rejected SIPO-Supported Proposals】\n\nMany real-world use case proposals were likely seen as more suitable for Catalyst than the Treasury, due to lower short-term ROI visibility or measurable KPIs.\n\nThat said, these proposals form the conceptual foundation of a future decentralized societal OS.\n\nWe strongly encourage these projects to resubmit for Round 2 or 2026, especially as ecosystem maturity catches up with their ambition.\n\n🗳️ SIPO Voting Record:\n👇\nhttps://t.co/TdUryU1iVT\n\n📅【Upcoming Timeline】\n• Mid-May: Round 2 Ekklesia signaling opens (proposal updates allowed)\n• June: 2nd Budget Info Action → On-chain voting\n• Summer onward: Governance and budget process refinement for 2026 cycle\n\n🧭【SIPO’s Next Actions】\n• Monitor and publicly track progress of the 40 passed proposals\n• Support re-submission of rejected proposals in culture, education, and DAO areas\n• Continue publishing reports and recommendations on decentralized governance\n• Maintain focused voting on regional DAOs, real-world use, and public-good-oriented initiatives\n\nSIPO is committed not just to speaking of a decentralized future,\nbut to actively designing it—one vote at a time.\n🫡 Let’s build the chain people actually use.\n🧭 And the community that actually governs it.\n\nDRep ID:\ndrep1yffld2866p00cyg3ejjdewtvazgah7jjgk0s9m7m5ytmmdq33v3zh"

Here’s a breakdown of the current situation:\n\n✅ Approved: The 2025 NCL of 350M ADA has been formally ratified by DReps. It’s based on a 2024 treasury income model (approx. 336M ADA) and now serves as the foundation for current budget deliberations.\n\n❌ Rejected: A more conservative proposal to cap 2025 at 300M ADA and 2026 at 250M ADA was not approved.\n\n🟠 Under Review:\n“2025 Cardano NCL” proposes lowering the NCL to 200M ADA, urging a cautious approach during this first year of decentralized treasury governance.\n“300M ADA for Epochs 563–635” aims to establish an NCL for early 2026, supporting budget continuity across overlapping periods.\n\nMeanwhile, several new funding proposals have been submitted:\n\n1⃣ 7.5M ADA for Community Builder Proposals — includes only those with ≥2.69B ADA support, excluding proposals from Intersect and founding entities.\n\n2⃣ 1.5M ADA for Amaru Rust Node Development — a PRAGMA-led initiative to diversify Cardano nodes and enhance network resilience.\n\n3⃣ 50M ADA for DeFi Liquidity — aims to seed liquidity into DEXs and stablecoins, with yield partially returned to the treasury.\n\nAs SIPO DRep, we’re evaluating these developments based on:\n\n🔍 Cautious governance: supports the 200M ADA NCL.\n🚀 Growth & momentum: supports maintaining the 350M ADA cap.\n⚖️ Balanced compromise: 300M ADA could be a pragmatic middle ground.\n\nFor funding proposals, our assessment will focus on:\nDoes it generate a return to the treasury?\nIs transparency and execution capacity ensured?\nDoes it set a strong precedent for the first year of decentralized financial governance?\n\nThe NCL is more than just a number — it reflects Cardano’s financial philosophy and growth trajectory. Changing the cap directly impacts which proposals are viable.\n\nWe’ll soon publish SIPO’s evaluation criteria and vote logic for each major proposal. In the meantime, we welcome your input before the voting begins.\n\nIf you support our work as a DRep, please consider delegating:\n\nDRep ID:\ndrep1yffld2866p00cyg3ejjdewtvazgah7jjgk0s9m7m5ytmmdq33v3zh\n\nFor Daedalus:\ndrep120m237kstm7pzywv5nwtjm8gj8dl55j9nupwlkapz77mgv7zu7l"

Instead, they are invited to submit their own governance actions for budget requests.\n\nI fully support this decision, as it aligns with the ongoing community debate about the Net Change Limit (NCL).\n\nThe current NCL is set at 350M ADA, but a reduction is expected. Two governance actions have been submitted to adjust the NCL to 200M or 300M ADA.\n\nTo minimize spending, it’s best to decide on-chain for each proposal individually, rather than bundling multiple proposals into a single governance action.\n\nThis approach prevents situations where DReps who support IOG’s budget feel obligated to also back community proposals they disagree with.\n\nGiven the circumstances, Intersect has made the right decision, and I appreciate their approach."

      "content": "### 预算的合宪性\n\n**目的**：本提案旨在通过增加生态系统中的稳定币流动性来增强 Cardano 的长期可持续性。\n\n**第三条第5款**：本提案通过包含标题、摘要、提案原因（动机与理由）和支持材料，满足了 Cardano Constitution 本条款的要求。本提案的链下副本可在 https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theeldermillenial/2025-liquidity-budget/refs/heads/master/info.jsonld 找到，并且文档哈希已附加到交易中，以满足本条款的其他要求。易于阅读的版本可在 https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theeldermillenial/2025-liquidity-budget/refs/heads/master/README.md 找到。\n\n**第四条第1款**：我们提议本预算涵盖73个epoch周期（约1个日历年）。\n\n**第四条第2款**：本预算的资金支付必须通过一个多重签名 (multisig) 钱包进行，该钱包由至少七名独立的管理成员组成，并采用4/7签名策略。资金监管流程随后需要七分之四的独立管理成员同意向 DeFi 协议支付资金。该钱包必须是存入 DeFi 协议的任何流动性的所有者，这意味着流动性代币或任何其他流动性保证必须保存在该多重签名钱包中，并且不应委托给第三方，除非资产转换为法定货币或铸造稳定币需要。通过此设计，该委员会将成为预算资金的管理人，并将直接监督向各协议的资金分配。\n\n**第四条第3款**：在提交之时，NCL 当前为3.5亿 ADA，并且只有一个请求150万 ADA 的预算通过信息行动 (info action) 在链上提交。我们认为，基于第四条第3款，这消除了本提案的一个潜在宪法障碍，因为本提案请求的5000万 ADA 未超出潜在剩余的3.485亿 ADA。\n\n**第四条第4款**：我们预算每月2,000 ADA（总计24,000 ADA）用于支付审计和透明度成本。拟议工作中构建仪表板和季度报告也履行了本条款的义务。由于所有资金将通过单一账户管理，包括所有流动性持有和管理委员会成员的月度津贴发放，我们认为仪表板和月度报告足以满足审计需求。为进一步加强我们对审计要求的承诺，我们还承诺通过信息行动 (Info Action) 响应任何社区驱动的独立审计请求，并将使用每月最高$50,000的预算与独立审计师合作。\n\n**第四条第5款**：拟议工作的性质满足了宪法第四条第5款的第一项要求。所有资产保存在由7名独立签署人组成的多重签名账户中，这提高了 Cardano 社区轻松审计和追踪委员会所采取行动的能力。为满足该条款的第二部分要求，资金将不会委托给 SPO，而是将委托给预定义的自动弃权投票选项。\n\n**TREASURY-04a**：本预算目前没有链上提款行动，除非本预算获得必要的50%批准，否则不会提交此类行动。",

The majority of the funds in this budget will be disbursed to DeFi protocols including decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and lending protocols to help seed liquidity on Cardano. The funds are managed by a 7 person administrating committee composed of publicly identified individuals who are part of multi-signature (multisig) wallet from which liquidity will be managed. This budget is proposed independent of other efforts since the goal of this budget is not to pay developers or companies for ecosystem improvements, rather to increase liquidity in the system overall. Further, unlike other proposals this budget serves as a revenue stream for the Cardano treasury since yields from DeFi protocols will be sent back to the Cardano treasury.",
          "rationale": "### Constitutionality of the Budget\n\n**Purpose**: This proposal is for work intended to enhance the long term sustainability of Cardano by increasing stablecoin liquidity in the ecosystem.\n\n**Article III(5)**: This proposal fulfills this section of the Cardano Constitution by containing a Title, Abstract, Reason for Proposal (Motivation and Rationale), and Supporting Materials. An off-chain copy of this proposal can be found at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theeldermillenial/2025-liquidity-budget/refs/heads/master/info.jsonld, and the document hash is attached to the transaction to fulfill the other requirements of this section. An easy to read version can be found at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theeldermillenial/2025-liquidity-budget/refs/heads/master/README.md\n\n**Article IV(1)**: We propose that this budget span 73 epochs (roughly 1 calendar year).\n\n**Article IV(2)**: Disbursements for this budget must be made to a multi-signature (multisig) wallet composed of at least seven independent administrating members with at 4 of 7 signing policy. The process of overseeing funds then requires 4 of the 7 independent administrating members agree to disbursement of funds to DeFi protocols. The wallet must be the owner of any liquidity deposited into DeFi protocols, meaning liquidity tokens or any other assurance of liquidity must be held in the multisig wallet and should not be delegated to a third party, except as required for conversion of assets to fiat or minting of stablecoins. With this design, the committee will be the administrator of the budget funds and will directly oversee distribution of funds to protocols.\n\n**Article IV(3)**: At the time of submission, the NCL is currently at 350 million ADA and there is only one budget requesting 1.5 million ADA that has been submitted on chain through an info action. We believe that this removes a potential constitutional barrier for this proposal based on Article IV(3), since this proposal requests 50 million ADA of the potential remaining 348.5 million ADA.\n\n**Article IV(4)**: We budget 2,000 ADA/month (24,000 ADA total) to cover the costs of audits and transparency. The building of a dashboard and quarterly reporting in the proposed work also fulfill the obligations of this section. Since all funds will be managed from a single account, including all liquidity holdings and disbursement of monthly stipends for administrating committee members, we believe the dashboard and monthly reports are sufficient for auditing. To further strengthen our commitment to the auditing requirement, we also commit to any community driven requests for independent audits via an Info Action, and will use funds up to the $50,000/month budget to work with an independent auditor.\n\n**Article IV(5)**: The nature of the proposed work fulfills the first requirement of Article IV(5) of the constitution. The holding of all assets in the multisig account composed of 7 independent signers improves the ability of the Cardano community to easily audit and track actions taken by the committee. To fulfill the second part of the section, funds will not be delegated to an SPO and will be delegated to the predefined auto-abstain voting option.\n\n**TREASURY-04a**: There is not on chain withdrawal action for this budget, and one will not be submitted unless this budget achieves the necessary 50% approval.",
          "motivation": "### High Level Overview\n\n* **Amount** - The Cardano treasury should dedicate 3.33% of treasury funds (50 million ada) to purchasing fiat backed stablecoins, spread out over 12 monthly purchases. The committee should make every effort to help mitigate the potential price impact of converting ADA to fiat to mint as stable coins over the 12 month period. Note that up to 35% of funds may be held in ADA to pair with ADA/Stablecoin pairs on DEXs, which will help to alleviate price impact concerns.\n* **Administration** - A 7 person administrating committee will manage the treasury reserve using a multisig wallet (4 of 7 signature validation) to hold and deploy funds to protocols. The administrating committee will be responsible for working with stablecoin issuers to convert ADA to fiat backed stablecoins and deploying liquidity. A specific focus of the administrating committee will be analyzing approaches of deploying ADA to stablecoins in a way that minimizes ADA price impact.\n* **Revenue** - Deployed funds will increase in value according to the interest and fees defined by the protocols fees are disbursed to. Each month the total interest generated by the deployed liquidity will be calculated and 15% of accumulated interest from protocols will be withdrawn from the respective protocols and sent back to the treasury, while the remaining 85% of accumulated interest will remain in the protocol (e.g. analagous but not identical to compounding interest). ADA held by the committee that is not deployed will not be staked according to constitutional requirements (see Rationale for more information).\n* **Deployment** - DeFi protocols with at least 250,000 ADA worth of a stablecoin may apply to be recipients of minted stablecoin, and the administrating committee will review and disburse funds to protocols that have the best plans for growth and returns back to the treasury. A maximum of 2 or 3 protocols may be used per DeFi category to help minimize fragmentation. Applicants should make a strong case for the use of their protocol, including a a description of historical success, security, dedicated support for handling issues, and features of the protocol that will maximize the value to the Cardano treasury if liquidity is deployed to the protocol. New protocols will not be excluded for having limited history, but must make a strong case in other areas of the application.\n* **Strategy** - The committee will deploy funds on a monthly basis in a way that minimizes ADA price impact and fees. A specific focus should be on deployment of liquidity that can be \"passively\" managed, meaning frequent adjustements are not needed. The focus on passive management is to help ease the management strategy and reduce the fees incurred by managing liquidity. This may be changed in the future by an on chain Info Action.\n* **Audits and Transparency** - The committee is responsible for creating a monthly report or building a dashboard (or both) to describe the ADA held in reserve, the funds deployed to protocols, and all fees and other costs associated with managing the treasury. The committee may use part of the monthly budget to develop a dashboard to provide live updates of the stablecoin reserve for the Cardano community.\n* **Costs** - Each member of the committee will be compensated $2,000/month in the fiat backed stablecoin of their choice ($14,000/month total for all committee members). The stablecoin reserve fund will cover the costs of minting fiat backed stables, deployment of liquidity to protocols, and rebalancing if needed. The committe will also use some funds to perform KYB/KYC of 3rd parties as needed as well as cover costs for creation of a legal entity to house the fund. Total costs per month should be capped at $50,000/month over the 12 month period. Any costs that extend beyond the budget period should be deducted from the accrued interest.\n* **Organization** - Part of the initial budget will be used to investigate proper incorporation of a legal entity to house the funds being managed for this budget. Every reasonable attempt should be made to house the fund in a non-profit to maximize tax benefits as well as provide future opportunities for organizations to donate to the fund.\n* **Revisions** - Since this fund may exist in perpetuity due to funds not being directly spent, it is important to have a mechanism for modification up to and including returning all funds back to the treasury. To this end, any member of the Cardano community may submit an Info Action to modify any aspect of this budget including members of the committee, monthly budget limits, committee pay, and returning some or all of funds back to the treasury. All members of the committee must commit to following any on chain Info Action that is passed by 67% of the community vote. If a committee member does not feel they can continue with their duties at any time, they must continue to carry out their duties until a suitable replacement is found according to the impeachment and replacement mechanisms described below.\n\n### Governing Committee\n\n#### Term Limits\n\nCommunity members have a maximum term limit of 2 years, after which they can re-apply for a second 2 year term. A minimum of 4 community members (not affiliated with founding entities) must be on the committee at all times.\n\nFounding entities may have at most 1 person each on the committee. There are no term limits for committee members that represent a founding entity, but must still abide by the removal process of an Info Action or a majority vote of the other committee members.\n\n#### Retirement and Impeachment\n\nIn the event that a committee member retires or their signing keys are exposed, the remaining members of the committee must create a new multisig address with the same policy (4 of 7) that removes the retired address. This process also gives the committee the capacity to impeach inactive members of the committee, as well as the ability for the community to impeach one or more members through an info action.\n\n#### Community Feedback\n\nThe administrating committee members should make themselves available to feedback and questions from the Cardano community, and make attempts to make changes that incorporate reasonable feedback from the community. Feedback can be received through a Telegram channel, on Twitter, scheduled town hall meetings not more than once per month. The administrating committee should make attempts to incorporate feedback from the Cardano community, but are not obligated to do so. If the administrating committee does not respond or refuses to incorporate changes, the Cardano community may submit an on chain Info Action (that achieves 67% approval) to compel the committee to make changes up to and including removal of one or more members and/or returning some or all funds back to the treasury.\n\n#### People\n\nBelow are 6 of the 7 members of the initial administrating committee. They range in experience and background to help ensure the long term success and sustainability of the stablecoin liquidity. There is an ongoing search for a 7th member of the committee and will be included in the withdrawal action.\n\n1.

If the administrating committee does not respond or refuses to incorporate changes, the Cardano community may submit an on chain Info Action (that achieves 67% approval) to compel the committee to make changes up to and including removal of one or more members and/or returning some or all funds back to the treasury.\n\n#### People\n\nBelow are 6 of the 7 members of the initial administrating committee. They range in experience and background to help ensure the long term success and sustainability of the stablecoin liquidity.

          "originalText": "Okay #Cardano Community, let's chat about the budget. I want to address two key fundamental issues that must be addressed before any meaningful conversation about amounts can be had. \n\n1. Who/what entity is the custodian of the funds.\n&\n2. Lump Sums  vs Tranches - Dissemination of Funds\n\n-----\nFirst off: let me say that I think this would make for a GREAT Space Place/Twitter Space convo (@adosiawolf ). \n\nOkay, so - who should be the custodian of the funds? Many people have argued for incremental releases of the funds as certain metrics are met. Here is where I think we need to first focus: \n\nAnnual Budget is ≠ to Catalyst. \n\nCatalyst acts as an incubator for startups. Annual budget does not (currently). Where as each individual proposal can be voted on via catalyst, we should not expect that same thing to translate to the annual budget. It is not the job of every $ADA holder to audit/hold accountable/track the progress of everything that is in the annual budget. We HAVE to delegate that responsibility to specific groups (working groups/committees/whatever flavor of group you'd like to insert). This is the only scalable way for something as large as a global ecosystem to function. Now, if the group of people tasked with overseeing their particular portion of the budget do a bad job, then the community should hold them accountable and vote them out/replace. The community's role is to vote for the group that oversees and keep them accountable, not to be giving marching orders down in the granular aspects of each line item of the budget. We have already seen what poor interaction Catalyst has due to the sheer amount of info. Why would this be any different for annual operating budget? So - does it require a certain amount of trust in the individuals who are overseeing that particular section of the budget? YES. Is that antithetical to blockchain? IMO, NO. We check and balance the people, not the granular. If you don't like how they choose to spend that portion of the budget, then vote them out for people who are more aligned with how you would like to see the funds spent. \n\nCadence/Distribution of funds: if we hold the above information to be the modus operandi, then this answers itself. You can't run payroll waiting on a new tranche of money each month. You have to have cash on hand. @IOHK_Charles made a great point last night in reference to contracts and deals and anyone who has done business understands this. I won't be the preverbal dead horse, but again, if the budget ≠ to catalyst, then tranches are out of the question. Lump sum to each area to execute on their respective budget area. \n\nThis is just to get the convo started. \nsummoning @RichardMcCrackn @radioastro @bigpeyYT @cryptorecruitr @hoskytoken @CardanoNoodz @KaizenCrypto  for exposure on the convo."

          "originalText": "I've taken the time to review the #Cardano 2025 budget materials, and here is my take 🔥\n\n1⃣ 300 - 500 Million $ADA is too much of an ask for any entity for the 2025 budget. \n\nEven if this amount of ADA is not sold all at once, opening up ~500 million ADA to be sold will have negative price implications on announcement alone.\n\nThis would harm all ADA holders and builders financially, which I am not willing to support.\n\n2⃣ Estimated treasury income for 2025 will be ~334 Million ADA, so we should not spend more than this.\n\nIf we want to do better than fiat governments, we should run a surplus not a deficit.\n\n3⃣ I am fully on board for an annual budget, it works better for the business world.\n\nAny long term contracts are totally possible as long as we are prioritizing what is most important to fund and working within our annual budget.\n\n4⃣ There will be a need to convert ADA to stable coins and to hedge risk for payouts. \n\nIntersect will be hedging risk and converting ADA based on monthly expenses, which is a good bar to measure by.\n\n@IntersectMBO  is currently set up to be the facilitator of the budget by IOG + the CF, and will be the group auditing and holding projects accountable.\n\nThere is a process already defined on how they will do this, which is great and includes quarterly reviews and milestones:\n\nhttps://t.co/MeysCdOhmy\n\nThere is an independent 3rd party entity, the Cardano Development Foundation (CDF) established in the Cayman Islands that holds the ADA and distributes it to Intersect (sole administrator and facilitator of CDF). \n\nThe CDF has a mandate to work for the betterment of the Cardano Community, so this is how the ADA will be protected.\n\n5⃣ Independent treasury withdraw requests outside of Intersect or the budget are entirely possible pending Constitutional Committee and DRep votes.\n\nIf something big comes up that requires funding it is still possible to request funds, so we should account for this outside of the @IntersectCBC budget.\n\n6⃣ Intersect ADA should not be staked, and this should be a condition of budget approval. \n\nThis will drain the treasury further, taking funds that are not approved in the budget. \n\nIf a staking initiative is created and applies for funding and gets approved, that is something different that should be considered under its own merits, critiques, and votes.\n\nIf there is an interest in furthering decentralization (which means supporting single pool operators), then there are many other actions that can be taken by Intersect, DReps, and CC members, like increasing K = 1000 or through the @Cardano_CF  staking program.\n\n7⃣ Intersect ADA should not be used to vote, and this should be a condition of budget approval. \n\nThis unbalances the ecosystem in a large and biased favor.\n\nIntersect does not intend to do this, but they have also stated they are beholden to Intersect members specifically, not all ADA holders.\n\nThis means if Intersect members vote for using Intersect ADA to vote, it is a possibility.\n\n🚀Based on everything that has been presented by both Intersect and Charles @IOHK_Charles , below is my recommended budget for Cardano 2025:\n\n- Intersect gets 50% of the projected treasury income for 2025 (which is a much less risky ask).\n- 25% is available for alternative spend requests (which are more cumbersome).\n- 25% goes into savings for the future.\n\nThis is of course flexible, but a much better starting point in my opinion. \n\nIf Catalyst @Catalyst_onX is included in the intersect buckets, then more ADA from the \"Extra\" category could be allocated to give Catalyst more funding. \n\nIt is unclear if Catalyst will fall under this or not, and this detail should be clear prior to budget approval - do you know @dannyribar @CatalystSwarm @radioastro ?\n\nIf Intersect needs more ADA than this, there should be a more detailed budget breakdown on their part as to why this extra ADA is needed, and where it is to be allocated.\n\nAll my numbers and docs publicly available 👇\nhttps://t.co/hTuuqbACBx\n\nCollected Intersect Materials available thanks to @ElCryptonaut 👇\nhttps://t.co/Tc6Fb1E5wY\n\nHighlight of Charles' AMA video 👇\nhttps://t.co/kufSlz1Nx0\n\nAnd full Video 👇\nhttps://t.co/ScYNHXHtVZ\n\nSee part 2 for more 🧵"

          "originalText": "A few observations about the Cardano budget.\n\nI am pleased with the total budget of 266.7M ADA. I expect revenue to be higher (about 320M ADA), so we will likely save ADA for the next few years.\n\nBeing in a bull market, it is advantageous to invest more for several reasons. \n\nAs the market price of ADA increases, getting a higher dollar value with a smaller amount of ADA coins becomes possible. \n\nAdditionally, smart investments can attract new users to the ecosystem. Let's expect that user activity will decline in the middle of 2026. \n\nThe likely reason for allocating only 60M ADA to the next three Catalyst Funds (20M for each fund) is the higher market price of ADA.\n\nWhat I find missing in the budget are investments in DeFi and the minting of stablecoins. \n\nI envision minting 1-2M stablecoins each epoch, such as USDM and DJED. The cost would be around 140M USD, which translates to about 140M ADA if the average price of ADA throughout the bull market is 1 USD. \n\nHowever, if the average price of ADA were higher, say 2 USD, the cost in the ADA value would be half as much. The budget calculates that 1 ADA is 0.5 USD. That doesn't seem adequate to me.\n\nThis is a topic we should discuss and consider.\n\nCan the current budget be reduced? Can we allocate ADA differently?\n\nI don’t want to criticize the high costs line by line without knowing all the details. I’ll use common sense. \n\nFeel free to correct me or provide important context.\n\nOn-chain governance seems excessively expensive to me. While DReps can vote on governance actions, Intersect and various committees will cost us tens of millions of ADA. \n\nWith such a high budget, we risk depleting a significant amount of ADA in the treasury during the next bear market.\n\nThe costs of the Budget Committee also seem high. Some processes could be more cost-effective. Do we really need a Budget Summit? DReps can meet at the Cardano Summit (see below).\n\nAllocating 20M ADA for IntersectMBO seems like a lot. \n\nWhen I looked at the individual items, the total was 2.7M ADA. Perhaps I am misunderstanding something.\n\nRegarding the Product Committee category, the costs appear high, especially for items that we may not need or that I believe were already ready.\n\nIf I'm not mistaken, the multi-resource consensus Minotaur is being built for Midnight, not Cardano. The same applies to Proof of Useful Work.\n\nI would like to focus primarily on scalability, ZK technology, L2s, and other technologies that Cardano needs as soon as possible. Some items in the budget can wait.\n\nI would like to see a budget linked to the roadmap. We need the strategy first. Then make the roadmap and link it with the budget.\n\nThe largest costs in the budget relate to the Technical Steering Committee. Core Maintenance will cost us 40M ADA. This seems like a huge expense and is worth investigating in more detail.\n\nIn the 80M ADA allocated for the Membership & Community Committee, 60M ADA is for three Catalyst Funds. This leaves us with 20M ADA to discuss. \n\nI have never heard of Community Hubs. I know there were proposals to create various hubs in Catalyst, and some were funded. Do we really need to invest 3.2M ADA in the Community Hub?\n\n11.2M ADA is allocated for The Civic Committee. This includes compensation for committee members and DReps. \n\n1.8M ADA is allocated for DReps, which is roughly 0.5% of the total budget. While the prevailing opinion is that DReps should work for free, I believe using 0.5% of the budget for their rewards is reasonable. DReps and committee members deserve some compensation.\n\nDReps decide on the budget. They can save ADA or better direct the budget.\n\nA topic worth discussing is whether DReps should be more involved in internal processes. DReps are elected by the community, and if they are interested, they should be members of committees and participate in tasks like compiling the budget. \n\nPerhaps only those DReps who are more involved in these processes should be paid.\n\nI would halve the 20M ADA allocated for the Growth & Marketing Committee. Cardano needs to invest in technology, not marketing. I more or less agree with the items in the Growth section.\n\n3.1M ADA is the cost for Cardano Summit 2026. I would agree with that and link it directly to other meetings, such as the DReps meeting and the debate on the next budget.\n\nI would definitely not pay influencers. I don't believe this type of marketing works.\n\nI approve of 3.8M ADA for the Open Source Committee and would gladly increase the budget if possible, provided we save money elsewhere.\n\nDespite my reservations about the budget and my efforts to reduce some costs, I might be willing to approve the budget. I'm not sure yet. I would like to see some changes.\n\nThe budget will still change based on community input, so please comment on the Cardano Forum.\n\nMy opinion is that we should save on marketing, maybe on Community Hubs, development of technologies that Cardano does not need in the next 2 years, and other items and rather mint stablecoins.\n\nEveryone will have a different opinion on the budget. It will be difficult to find consensus in a decentralized environment. Therefore, I will tend to approve the budget unless I find a fundamental problem. I will continue to examine the budget and comment on it if needed.\n\nI am curious about the final version."

I support the idea but I think it needs some amendments providing more details and specifications before I can vote for it as a treasury withdrawal motion. Here's the feedback I left on your proposal on https://t.co/xCm5Kkm0f2\n\n\"While I am in favor of supplying stablecoin liquidity from the treasury (you definately convinced me on that score), I don't think this proposal is complete enough to qualify as a proper treasury expenditure proposal yet. I think this should be an info-action proposal because it is TOO VAGUE. \n\nThis proposal does not define several key elements such what % of the 50M ADA will be minted into which stablecoins? (50% USDM, 50% USDA? 33% iUSD, 33% USDA, 33% USDM?) It also does not specify what market maker(s) is proposed to execute the liquidity provision. It also does not account for how much and how the oversight committee and the market maker will be compensated for their services. How much of this 50M proposed expenditure can we expect will actually end up as stablecoins in Cardano? Similarly, The proposal specifies \"guidelines\" and \"legal agreements\" that the market maker must follow, but it does not go into any detail about them. All of the above could be overlooked if the proposal specified WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING THOSE DECISIONS. Unfortunately, it does not. \n\nFor actions like this the outcome often depends on the details, and we have no details to evaluate or an administrative team to whose competency we can vet. For all the good arguments and suggestions in this proposal, it doesn't explain itself thoroughly enough to win my vote as a formal treasury withdrawal motion. I would vote for it as an info action. WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT THE DETAILS ARE, OR WHO WILL MAKE THOSE DECISIONS.\""

          "originalText": "As a DRep, I have decided to vote YES on the governance action regarding the setting of the Net Change Limit (NCL). ✅🫡\n\nRead my rationale:\n\nThe Governance Action (GA) proposes an NCL of 300M ADA for 2025 and 250M ADA for 2026.\n\nIt is crucial that the NCL does not exceed the expected revenues of the Treasury. A prudent economist aims to ensure expenses remain below revenues while also building reserves for the future.\n\nPersonally, I would prefer an NCL of 280M ADA for 2025 and 230M ADA for 2026. That said, I recognize that during a bull market, we can afford to allocate more funds—potentially even using Treasury resources to buy stablecoins.\n\nFor Cardano to thrive, it must remain in the top 10 blockchain platforms in the coming years and stay competitive. Achieving this requires consistent investment, particularly in scalability.\n\nFrom a long-term perspective, Cardano must also prepare for resistance against quantum computers. This will demand significant investment over the next decade, which needs to be factored into current planning.\n\nThe Intersect budget is estimated at 260M ADA—lower than the proposed NCL. I believe this budget can be reduced; however, even if it isn't, it will remain within the limits set by this GA. Therefore, the NCL will not hinder ecosystem funding.\n\nI propose utilizing the Treasury to mint stablecoins within the Cardano ecosystem, which could generate yield and serve as an additional revenue stream. At present, ADA fee revenue does not meet expectations, and diversifying income sources is critical.\n\nYield generation could also be redistributed as staking rewards. If ADA could capture the success of the Cardano ecosystem, it could have a positive impact on the market capitalization.\n\nThese are the reasons I advocate for setting the NCL above the Intersect budget.\n\nHowever, I do acknowledge the risks. If a new NCL is not approved for 2027, the last approved NCL—250M ADA—will remain in effect. This could result in spending exceeding Treasury income that year. Nevertheless, I am confident the community will successfully ratify a new NCL when the time comes.\n\nIn my opinion, the NCL should be calculated as a percentage of Treasury income from the previous year. \n\nFor instance, if Treasury income totaled 300M ADA during the last 73 epochs and the NCL was set at 90%, the spending limit would be 270M ADA.\n\nImportant monetary parameters are currently defined as percentages, and it would be wise to maintain this convention. Additionally, such a mechanism could provide stability and predictability over multiple years without requiring frequent adjustments.\n\nAs the GA indicates, the method of setting the NCL can always be revised. I do not intend to promote my own perspective by rejecting other Governance Actions.\n\nI appreciate that this GA originates from the community rather than from founding entities. It is encouraging to see the community assuming greater responsibility.\n\nThe proposed NCLs for the next two years are reasonable and align with long-term sustainability. It is crucial not to delay investments in ecosystem development. The sooner we approve the NCL, the better.\n\nDisclaimer: If an alternative GA proposing a different NCL emerges and aligns more closely with my views, I may reconsider my vote. It makes sense to support only one proposal.\n\nMy DRep ID:\ndrep1km69g7ksf8t5g0h9d9tkrcd2tezxelx0wtr76rv2mrkl5nzd6v3"

The proposers have stated that from January 5th, 2024, Epoch 459, through December 30th, Epoch 531, the actual total income into the Cardano Treasury was 335,957,093 ada.\n\nThe proposed NCL is 350M ada. This is roughly 14M ada higher than the total income in the Cardano Treasury for 2024. I welcome the proposed reference to modelling and the reference to a previous period for which we have data. \n\nThe motion uses modelling of ADA inflow for the previous year as the main basis for approving an NCL. It is indeed one of the factors that must be considered.\n \nWhat I am missing in this proposal - as it proposes a relatively large NCL - is even a minor economic analysis of how approvals of different NCLs could impact the valuation of ADA. An NCL of 350M ADA is sending a signal to the market. What is this signal? \n\nHow does it compare to previous signals? If we do not have the data, is there room for a prediction at least?\nWith the lack of this economic/monetary analysis, we are left to speculate. My feeling is that NCL approvals in the future will become defining moments that shape the ADA exchange rate vs the USD. It is a signal how much ADA could be released - a signal approved by the majority of DReps. \n\nThe approval of a large NCL could have an immediate price impact on the value of ADA, thus diminishing the purchase power of the 350M ADA. Before the budget elements are approved. \n\nAfter approving a large NCL, the budgetary discussions will probably take place in the shadow of a lower ADA/USD exchange rate. Thus we might be forced by the market to push an annual budget towards the top limit of the NCL. We could create a self-fulfilling prophesy. \n\nThe problem I see with a very large first year NCL is that our budgetary and governance processes are the weakest and most inefficient in the first year. Our ability to audit, prevent waste and abuse are questionable. A lower NCL would focus minds.\n\nWithout a monetary/economic analysis or forecast, I would consider voting for a NCL in the 200-250M ADA in 2025 (depending on the text of the NCL proposal) as it would give a better signal to the market about our intentions to balance the development of the system and the intention to safeguard the value of ADA and Cardano's Top 10 position. Especially, as our abilities to manage the potential spending of so much ADA in the early days of decentralized governance are the lowest. \n\nI see this conservative approach as something that protects the interests of ADA holders and stakers. \n\nBest practice: We SHOULD approve the closest NCL to the actual budget that we want as DReps. By approving a much larger NCL we will be devaluing the ada currency BEFORE any budget is approved and before the contractors receive the ADA. Effectively crippling ourselves unnecessarily. \n\nIf the intention is to approve a lower budget than 350M ada as some (many?) DReps seem to have indicated, then to preserve the value of that ada for those who will receive it, the best thing we can do is to vote for an NCL that is closest to that intended 2025 budget total."

The UX is terrible for viewing multiple proposals, and there is no high level data aggregation which makes everything more difficult for DReps.\n\nTo help streamline things for all of us, I’ve made a budget spreadsheet with the data from the https://t.co/FPs8Wq7glV budget proposals here 👇\n\nhttps://t.co/kNdhf2u6w7\n\nFor some reason everyone can pick their rate of conversion for ADA to USD, which just makes a big mess of the numbers with variable conversion rates and has resulted in errors.\n\nI’ve flagged all proposals in red that have incorrect ADA to USD conversion rates, and have also created a balanced conversion rate for all proposals at the same rate that the @IntersectCBC  budget has been converted at ($0.50 USD).\n\nProviding everything in the currently submitted budget passes, we would still come under Net Change Limit if it is decided that this should be 350,000,000 ADA.\n\nWe are looking at 265,387,604 ADA from the Intersect budget, and 62,916,370 ADA from these new budget submissions.\n\nThis would put us at 328,303,974 $ADA , not including any new additions or any budget submissions by the CF or Emurgo.\n\nI personally want to spend significantly less than 350 Million ADA, so I will be voting no on the majority of these new proposals.\n\nI also think that the current Intersect budget still needs some cutting and further explaining, but this new budget process has been a great deflection to get eyes off of the existing @IntersectMBO budget 👀\n\nYou can see my full discussion on the Cardano 2025 budget here on the Cardano Forum:\n\nhttps://t.co/BvJNWbBvjf"

          "text": "我的预算提案理由\n\n我支持了23个项目，总计2.222亿 ADA。我对所有其他项目都投了反对票。\n\n各类别支持的项目数量：\n\n• 核心：17\n• 研究：2\n• 营销与创新：2\n• 治理支持：2\n\n我支持的3个最大项目是 IOG 核心开发、IO 研究和 Catalyst。\n\n这3个项目占了1.93亿 ADA。\n\n我曾犹豫是否支持 IOG 研究。过去发表了许多学术论文。我们明年的研究项目清单并非都需要。现在有必要更多地支持实施和生态系统，在我看来，这方面落后于研究。\n\n另一方面，Cardano 的成功在很大程度上基于研究和使用形式化方法的高质量实施。\n\n不支持研究将是一个倒退。清单上的一些东西将来可能会实施。\n\n我下次的建议是为每个项目创建单独的提案，而不是一个包含许多项目的提案。这也适用于核心开发。\n\n正如我之前提到的，我认为 Catalyst 是大多数项目应该申请资金的地方。所以我支持它。\n\n在审查预算提案期间，我注意到在许多情况下，只有大约2-3名 DReps 投票。在最好的情况下，大约10名，很少有20名左右。这是一个非常低的参与率。\n\nCatalyst 并不完美，但它已经改进了好几年，团队经验丰富，而且它是一个经过实战检验的工具。ADA 持有者已经熟悉该系统。此外，还计划进行进一步的改进。\n\n目前，我认为没有理由用预算提案取代 Catalyst。\n\n我的另一个建议是，一旦 NCL 获得批准，IOG 应该为其提案提交单独的 GA。这将避免 DReps 在一个 GA 中对包含许多其他项目的 GA 进行投票的情况。\n\n我只用了2900万 ADA 来支持其他23个项目。\n\n在我看来，这些是生态系统迫切需要的项目。\n\n我认为 Midgard、Starstream、Hydra、ZK Rollups、一个替代的 Cardano 节点、与 Bitcoin 的集成以及其他几个项目都是必须拥有的项目。\n\n如果我遇到多个类似的提案，我更喜欢开源项目和社区熟知的实体，或者那些已经交付了至今仍在使用的项目的实体。\n\n我想强调的是，如果我投了反对票，可能意味着：\n\n• 我不喜欢这个项目。它不应该从财政部（或 Catalyst）获得资金。\n\n• 我喜欢这个项目，它应该向 Catalyst 申请资金。\n\n总的来说，我认为有商业成功雄心的项目应该寻找其他资金来源。\n\n我不喜欢风险业务由财政部资助，而在成功的情况下利润被私有化的情况。\n\n如果项目申请财政部资金，它们应该制定一个策略，在成功的情况下将部分利润返还给社区。\n\n此外，我认为如果是一家初创公司，团队不能指望开发人员能拿到和 IOG 开发人员一样的薪水。部分风险必须由团队承担，而不仅仅是财政部。\n\n有些项目没有商业性质，例如库、开发工具等。我们应该识别这些项目，评估它们的益处，并可能支持它们。\n\n我支持的最后一个主要项目是 Cardano 基金会的营销策略。这也包括 Cardano 峰会。\n\n总的来说，我不希望支持那些持有 Genesis 代币但尚未使用的创始实体的项目。Cardano 基金会就是这样的实体，这在上一期 Catalyst 基金中得到了负面反映。\n\n另一方面，这个提案是营销类别中最好的。Cardano 基金会支持生态系统中的许多活动。CF 希望长期保持活跃并支持生态系统建设，为此它需要获得资金。\n\nCardano 峰会和其他营销活动的成本可能很高。我不希望冒这样的风险：如果他们的提案未获批准，下一届 Cardano 峰会将无法举办。加密行业可能会对此产生负面看法。\n\n我只支持了 Intersect 关于开源开发预算的一项提案。他们要求580万 ADA。\n\n每天都有新的提案出现，所以我的决定可能不是最终的。我可能会做出改变。\n\n我的 DRep ID：\ndrep1km69g7ksf8t5g0h9d9tkrcd2tezxelx0wtr76rv2mrkl5nzd6v3",

Let's use the treasury to seed stablecoin liquidity to help prepare for the bull run. I've written a proposal with @Marco_112358. If you haven't, I recommend giving it a read.\n\nOne of the key aspects of the proposal is that no single entity can control the withdrawn funds, since funds will be withdrawn into a multi-sig wallet. The multi-sig wallet will be controlled by a management committee, where 4 of 7 signatures are required to take any action with the funds.\n\nThe 7 person committee will be composed of 1 representative from each of the founding entities (@emurgo_io, @InputOutputHK, and @Cardano_CF) and 4 community members. This partnership between the community and founding entities helps to pair the passion of the community with the interests and resources of the founding entities.\n\nPlease do share and leave feedback.

We’re in a historical transition.\n\nOur responsibility is to document this process—its flaws, its breakthroughs, and everything in between—so that what we leave behind is a legacy, not just a result.\n\nIn this way, our mistakes and successes both become tools for future growth.\n\n🔁 I believe the Cardano ecosystem must thrive through free and open competition.\n\nFor that to happen, any proposal or authority must be evaluated and, if necessary, challenged openly.\n\nAnd that starts with us—with the community choosing to observe, report, and remember.\n\nCardano will evolve through our collective will and action.\n\nLet’s build something we can be proud to pass on.\nLet me know if you’d like this adapted for a Twitter/X thread or shortened for another format!"

          "originalText": "@JaromirTesar \n\nScalability and Funding - Plan is still the same.  Last I checked both Midgard and IOG teams are still making good progress on things, despite the fact that we have not withdrawn from the Cardano treasury in a very long time.  I don't think another 6 weeks while we pursue a better will slow progress meaningfully.\n\nCatalyst Funding - I'm not aware of these ecosystem teams that are \"fighting for survival\".  Catalyst has already been funded up through F13.  And how would any of these projects know that they would be approved for funding anyways?  IMHO a 6-week delay is perfectly fine.\n\nFlexibility of Governance - I'm aware that a new NCL can be passed that is lower.  However, I worry that once we have a high NCL passed, many of the top dReps who happen to have budget proposals will rigorously defend the high limit so that their proposals have a better chance.  Better to approve a low NCL and then raise it later if we have to IMHO.\n\nMarket Timing and Investment Windows - I don't think any of the budget proposals mentioned so far move the needle enough in a positive direction to be worth the ADA they are asking for.  What is the PMF we are trying to market?  What strategic initiatives other than ones in IOG's core proposal, Midgard, Starstream, Amaru, and Gerolamo are needed?  All of those combined are still less than 200M ADA.  Also, I support a stablecoin liquidity proposal, but it needs to be decoupled from Emurgo's omnibus proposal IMHO.\n\nChecks and Balances - The issue here is not necessarily that dReps will want to spend up to the cap.  It's that budget proposers will.  We don't have enough visibility into ANY of the proposals' true costs.  Example:  Maybe with a 150M NCL, IOG might propose 50M for their core proposal.  With 350M NCL, there is enough room for them to ask for 100M first just to see if it passes.  We WANT budget proposers to be *LIMITED* by the NCL to get them to compete to lower costs.\n\nMisuse Isn’t Solved by NCL Alone - Agreed.  But IMHO lowering the NCL will cause proposers to increase the *quality* of their proposals in order to compete with other proposers for a slice of a smaller pie.\n\nSelling Pressure and Timing - ADA is currently 5x below ATH.  I very much doubt that it will be on its way back down again 6 weeks from now.  In fact I think if we delay a little bit we'll be more likely to stretch the value of our ADA spent to go much further.\n\nThese are some of the main reasons I am strongly against approving a 350M NCL right now."

The reading of the constitution suggests there might be room for multiple budgets.\n\nDoes that mean one budget could be set for IOG/Intersect/etc and another could be set for other initiatives?\n\nI'm asking because a 200 million NCL would have a major negative impact on my 50 million stablecoin liquidity proposal since it would create competition between my proposal and the founding entities budgeting. This would very negatively impact the capacity for me to try and bring the community and founding entities together for something that could benefit Cardano.\n\nI want to try and bring everyone together to help build better relationships while working on a program that will support the treasury and community in the long term. However, this whole budget process is turning a lot of people into enemies that should be trying to work together."

Thought it might be helpful to post for everyone what the Cardano Constitution requires:\n\n1. An administrator Is Constitutionally Required--\nThe Constitution mandates that all Cardano ecosystem budgets must designate one or more administrators to oversee treasury funds. Without Intersect acting as administrator (or the emergence of a different administrator acceptable to DReps) no budget can fulfill this requirement.\n→ Constitution Reference: Article IV, Section 2\n\n2. No Administrator means no budget—and No Governance Execution--\nTreasury withdrawals cannot occur unless they are part of an approved budget and under the supervision of a designated administrator. Without funding for Intersect (or the emergence of a different administrator acceptable to DReps) there is no administrator—effectively halting the execution of any governance action involving treasury funds.\n→ Constitution Reference: Article IV, Sections 2 & 3; Guardrails TREASURY-04a\n\n3. Administrators Enable Treasury Withdrawals--\nOnly an approved budget that includes an administrator allows treasury withdrawals. Intersect (or a different entity acceptable to DReps, acting as the administrator) is thus essential to implement any community-approved funding, ensuring the budget's legitimacy and compliance.\n→ Constitution Reference: Article IV, Sections 2 & 3; Guardrails TREASURY-01a to TREASURY-04a\n\n4. Intersect (or  a different entity acceptable to DReps) acting as the administrator, ensures Budget Oversight, Transparency, and Audits--\nThe Constitution requires that all treasury withdrawals include allocations for independent audits and oversight metrics. Intersect (or  a different entity acceptable to DReps, acting as the administrator) fulfills this role by managing separate, auditable accounts and implementing governance-related dispute resolution.\n→ Constitution Reference: Article IV, Section 4 & 5\n\n5. Intersect (or a different entity acceptable to DReps, acting as the administrator) sustains Governance Infrastructure--\nThe Constitution expects the community to maintain off-chain governance processes. Intersect, as an MBO, supports essential infrastructure including tooling, process administration, and the Constitutional Committee’s operational needs. Another entity would have to step up to take on this role if Intersect ceases to exist.\n→ Constitution Reference: Article III, Section 6; Article VII, Sections 7 & 8\n\n6. No Administrator Risks the Entire Governance Model-\nIntersect’s (or a different  administrator's) administrative function is foundational and mandatory to Cardano’s governance. Without a funded administrator, no treasury-based governance actions can proceed, undermining DReps’ decisions and threatening the continuity of decentralized governance.\n→ Constitution Reference: Article IV, Sections 2–5; Article VII, Section 4"

          "originalText": "Stable coin proposal full version below:\n\nAbstract\nThe goal of this proposal is to increase liquidity on Cardano, specifically by supporting stablecoin liquidity. 50,000,000 ADA is requested over the course of 12 months (the duration of the budget) to support the Cardano decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. The majority of the funds in this budget will be disbursed to DeFi protocols including decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and lending protocols to help seed liquidity on Cardano. The funds are managed by a 7 person administrating committee composed of publicly identified individuals who are part of multi-signature (multisig) wallet from which liquidity will be managed. This budget is proposed independent of other efforts since the goal of this budget is not to pay developers or companies for ecosystem improvements, rather to increase liquidity in the system overall. Further, unlike other proposals this budget serves as a revenue stream for the Cardano treasury since yields from DeFi protocols will be sent back to the Cardano treasury.\n\nMotivation\nHigh Level Overview\nAmount - The Cardano treasury should dedicate 3.33% of treasury funds (50 million ada) to purchasing fiat backed stablecoins, spread out over 12 monthly purchases. The committee should make every effort to help mitigate the potential price impact of converting ADA to fiat to mint as stable coins over the 12 month period. Note that up to 35% of funds may be held in ADA to pair with ADA/Stablecoin pairs on DEXs, which will help to alleviate price impact concerns.\nAdministration - A 7 person administrating committee will manage the treasury reserve using a multisig wallet (4 of 7 signature validation) to hold and deploy funds to protocols. The administrating committee will be responsible for working with stablecoin issuers to convert ADA to fiat backed stablecoins and deploying liquidity. A specific focus of the administrating committee will be analyzing approaches of deploying ADA to stablecoins in a way that minimizes ADA price impact.\nRevenue - Deployed funds will increase in value according to the interest and fees defined by the protocols fees are disbursed to. Each month the total interest generated by the deployed liquidity will be calculated and 15% of accumulated interest from protocols will be withdrawn from the respective protocols and sent back to the treasury, while the remaining 85% of accumulated interest will remain in the protocol (e.g. analagous but not identical to compounding interest). ADA held by the committee that is not deployed will not be staked according to constitutional requirements (see Rationale for more information).\nDeployment - DeFi protocols with at least 250,000 ADA worth of a stablecoin may apply to be recipients of minted stablecoin, and the administrating committee will review and disburse funds to protocols that have the best plans for growth and returns back to the treasury. A maximum of 2 or 3 protocols may be used per DeFi category to help minimize fragmentation. Applicants should make a strong case for the use of their protocol, including a a description of historical success, security, dedicated support for handling issues, and features of the protocol that will maximize the value to the Cardano treasury if liquidity is deployed to the protocol. New protocols will not be excluded for having limited history, but must make a strong case in other areas of the application.\nStrategy - The committee will deploy funds on a monthly basis in a way that minimizes ADA price impact and fees. A specific focus should be on deployment of liquidity that can be \"passively\" managed, meaning frequent adjustements are not needed. The focus on passive management is to help ease the management strategy and reduce the fees incurred by managing liquidity. This may be changed in the future by an on chain Info Action.\nAudits and Transparency - The committee is responsible for creating a monthly report or building a dashboard (or both) to describe the ADA held in reserve, the funds deployed to protocols, and all fees and other costs associated with managing the treasury. The committee may use part of the monthly budget to develop a dashboard to provide live updates of the stablecoin reserve for the Cardano community.\nCosts - Each member of the committee will be compensated $2,000/month in the fiat backed stablecoin of their choice ($14,000/month total for all committee members). The stablecoin reserve fund will cover the costs of minting fiat backed stables, deployment of liquidity to protocols, and rebalancing if needed. The committe will also use some funds to perform KYB/KYC of 3rd parties as needed as well as cover costs for creation of a legal entity to house the fund. Total costs per month should be capped at $50,000/month over the 12 month period. Any costs that extend beyond the budget period should be deducted from the accrued interest.\nOrganization - Part of the initial budget will be used to investigate proper incorporation of a legal entity to house the funds being managed for this budget. Every reasonable attempt should be made to house the fund in a non-profit to maximize tax benefits as well as provide future opportunities for organizations to donate to the fund.\nRevisions - Since this fund may exist in perpetuity due to funds not being directly spent, it is important to have a mechanism for modification up to and including returning all funds back to the treasury. To this end, any member of the Cardano community may submit an Info Action to modify any aspect of this budget including members of the committee, monthly budget limits, committee pay, and returning some or all of funds back to the treasury. All members of the committee must commit to following any on chain Info Action that is passed by 67% of the community vote. If a committee member does not feel they can continue with their duties at any time, they must continue to carry out their duties until a suitable replacement is found according to the impeachment and replacement mechanisms described below.\nGoverning Committee\nTerm Limits\nCommunity members have a maximum term limit of 2 years, after which they can re-apply for a second 2 year term. A minimum of 4 community members (not affiliated with founding entities) must be on the committee at all times.\n\nFounding entities may have at most 1 person each on the committee. There are no term limits for committee members that represent a founding entity, but must still abide by the removal process of an Info Action or a majority vote of the other committee members.\n\nRetirement and Impeachment\nIn the event that a committee member retires or their signing keys are exposed, the remaining members of the committee must create a new multisig address with the same policy (4 of 7) that removes the retired address. This process also gives the committee the capacity to impeach inactive members of the committee, as well as the ability for the community to impeach one or more members through an info action.\n\nCommunity Feedback\nThe administrating committee members should make themselves available to feedback and questions from the Cardano community, and make attempts to make changes that incorporate reasonable feedback from the community. Feedback can be received through a Telegram channel, on Twitter, scheduled town hall meetings not more than once per month. The administrating committee should make attempts to incorporate feedback from the Cardano community, but are not obligated to do so. If the administrating committee does not respond or refuses to incorporate changes, the Cardano community may submit an on chain Info Action (that achieves 67% approval) to compel the committee to make changes up to and including removal of one or more members and/or returning some or all funds back to the treasury.\n\nPeople\nBelow are 6 of the 7 members of the initial administrating committee. They range in experience and background to help ensure the long term success and sustainability of the stablecoin liquidity. There is an ongoing search for a 7th member of the committee and will be included in the withdrawal action.\n\nLinda Roland (aka CryptoFly)Twitter - @cryptofly777\nYouTube - https://t.co/FbNtOdQ1ML\nAbout - Linda Roland is the operator of MALU Pool and has been actively contributing to the Cardano ecosystem since 2021.

I’m an engineer by day, and at all times a dancer, humanitarian, idealist, and entrepreneur. With a strong foundation in cloud technologies, programming, and blockchain, I’m passionate about building tools and communities that make decentralized futures more accessible — and a little more fun.\n\nRationale\nConstitutionality of the Budget\nPurpose: This proposal is for work intended to enhance the long term sustainability of Cardano by increasing stablecoin liquidity in the ecosystem.\nArticle III(5): This proposal fulfills this section of the Cardano Constitution by containing a Title, Abstract, Reason for Proposal (Motivation and Rationale), and Supporting Materials. An off-chain copy of this proposal can be found at https://t.co/uJRvuGJ3SG, and the document hash is attached to the transaction to fulfill the other requirements of this section.\nArticle IV(1): We propose that this budget span 73 epochs (roughly 1 calendar year).\nArticle IV(2): Disbursements for this budget must be made to a multi-signature (multisig) wallet composed of at least seven independent administrating members with at 4 of 7 signing policy. The process of overseeing funds then requires 4 of the 7 independent administrating members agree to disbursement of funds to DeFi protocols. The wallet must be the owner of any liquidity deposited into DeFi protocols, meaning liquidity tokens or any other assurance of liquidity must be held in the multisig wallet and should not be delegated to a third party, except as required for conversion of assets to fiat or minting of stablecoins. With this design, the committee will be the administrator of the budget funds and will directly oversee distribution of funds to protocols.\nArticle IV(3): At the time of submission, the NCL is currently at 350 million ADA and there is only one budget requesting 1.5 million ADA that has been submitted on chain through an info action. We believe that this removes a potential constitutional barrier for this proposal based on Article IV(3), since this proposal requests 50 million ADA of the potential remaining 348.5 million ADA.\nArticle IV(4): We budget 2,000 ADA/month (24,000 ADA total) to cover the costs of audits and transparency. The building of a dashboard and quarterly reporting in the proposed work also fulfill the obligations of this section. Since all funds will be managed from a single account, including all liquidity holdings and disbursement of monthly stipends for administrating committee members, we believe the dashboard and monthly reports are sufficient for auditing. To further strengthen our commitment to the auditing requirement, we also commit to any community driven requests for independent audits via an Info Action, and will use funds up to the $50,000/month budget to work with an independent auditor.\nArticle IV(5): The nature of the proposed work fulfills the first requirement of Article IV(5) of the constitution. The holding of all assets in the multisig account composed of 7 independent signers improves the ability of the Cardano community to easily audit and track actions taken by the committee. To fulfill the second part of the section, funds will not be delegated to an SPO and will be delegated to the predefined auto-abstain voting option.\nTREASURY-04a: There is not on chain withdrawal action for this budget, and one will not be submitted unless this budget achieves the necessary 50% approval. @ElderM @Marco_112358 @ESCOweb3 @palmeconomy @nbxcom @planetmaaz here is the link on govtools https://t.co/PVhnhZyXTF"

          "text": "✅ 我投票赞成了 Amaru 项目。\n\n我的理由\n\n节点多样性对于去中心化和网络弹性至关重要。当多个独立团队构建节点软件时，可以减少对单一实体（例如 Cardano 的 IOG）的依赖。\n\n它最大限度地降低了与单一文化软件开发相关的系统性风险。\n\n区块链网络的核心承诺之一是高可用性，包括对攻击和审查的强大抵抗力。\n\n虽然没有系统可以保证100%的正常运行时间，但拥有多个节点实现可以提高网络的稳健性。如果某个版本中存在错误或漏洞，其他版本可能不受影响，从而限制潜在的损害。\n\n鼓励额外的节点实现也有助于加深对协议的理解。随着越来越多的开发人员构建和维护节点，他们有助于完善协议规范，发现模糊之处，并提高长期可维护性。\n\n这也通过建立更清晰、经过更多实战检验的标准来支持未来的客户端。\n\n相比之下，Bitcoin 在很大程度上依赖于单一实现：Bitcoin Core。虽然存在替代方案（例如 btcd、Bitcoin Knots），但它们很少被使用，这使得网络严重依赖于单一的开发团队。\n\n在围绕 OP_RETURN 操作码和 Ordinals 的使用等治理争议期间，这种中心化变得尤为明显。\n\n相比之下，Ethereum 为其共识层和执行层都拥有多个积极维护的实现。其中包括 Geth、Nethermind、Besu、Erigon（执行层）和 Prysm、Lighthouse、Teku、Nimbus（共识层）等客户端。\n\n这种多样性增强了 Ethereum 的去中心化，并使网络对任何单个客户端中的错误和性能问题更具弹性。\n\n然而，节点多样性也带来了挑战。\n\n如果未经仔细测试，不同的实现可能会导致共识错误或临时的链分叉。\n\n协调的测试网和协议级别的规范清晰度对于降低这些风险至关重要。\n\n协议升级也可能需要更长的时间，因为所有实现都必须集成和验证更改，例如即将到来的 Ouroboros Leios，IOG 和 Amaru 节点都需要支持。\n\n持续的资金是另一个考虑因素。\n\n维护多个完整的节点实现是资源密集型的，并且可能需要 Cardano 财政部的长期支持。\n\n然而，这种多样性带来的去中心化、安全性和社区参与度的提高证明了成本的合理性。\n\nAmaru 团队的资金请求是合理的，特别是与 IOG 所需的预算相比。\n\n该团队包括来自 Cardano 生态系统内部受人尊敬的开发人员，并得到多个信誉良好的实体的支持。他们提出的基于 Rust 的节点实现将是 IOG 基于 Haskell 的 Cardano 节点的一个重要替代方案，标志着生态系统弹性向前迈出了关键一步。\n\n这一举措加强了去中心化，提高了协议的稳健性，并代表了 Cardano 网络的健康发展。\n\n我的 DRep ID：\ndrep1km69g7ksf8t5g0h9d9tkrcd2tezxelx0wtr76rv2mrkl5nzd6v3",

Managed treasury funds which are designed to deepen liquidity as a public good / service cannot be subject to DeFi protocol fees. \n\nThis is of critical importance, as without this, we can easily end up in a situation where treasury funds are eaten up by DeFi protocol DAOs (a single order with a 0.3% fee on 50,000,000 Ada incurs a 150,000 Ada fee).\n\nAdditionally, while this is not a hard requirement for me, I would like to see the proposed stablecoin breakdown. It would be best if the liquidity could all be injected into a single stablecoin, otherwise this amount is insufficient to solve the slippage problem (which is why current stablecoins have low utilization / adoption). We need a single stablecoin with at-least 50M USD in active DEX liquidity, or as close to it as we can get."

Here’s a breakdown of the current situation:\n\n✅ Approved: The 2025 NCL of 350M ADA has been formally ratified by DReps. It’s based on a 2024 treasury income model (approx. 336M ADA) and now serves as the foundation for current budget deliberations.\n\n❌ Rejected: A more conservative proposal to cap 2025 at 300M ADA and 2026 at 250M ADA was not approved.\n\n🟠 Under Review:\n“2025 Cardano NCL” proposes lowering the NCL to 200M ADA, urging a cautious approach during this first year of decentralized treasury governance.\n“300M ADA for Epochs 563–635” aims to establish an NCL for early 2026, supporting budget continuity across overlapping periods.\n\nMeanwhile, several new funding proposals have been submitted:\n\n1⃣ 7.5M ADA for Community Builder Proposals — includes only those with ≥2.69B ADA support, excluding proposals from Intersect and founding entities.\n\n2⃣ 1.5M ADA for Amaru Rust Node Development — a PRAGMA-led initiative to diversify Cardano nodes and enhance network resilience.\n\n3⃣ 50M ADA for DeFi Liquidity — aims to seed liquidity into DEXs and stablecoins, with yield partially returned to the treasury.\n\nAs SIPO DRep, we’re evaluating these developments based on:\n\n🔍 Cautious governance: supports the 200M ADA NCL.\n🚀 Growth & momentum: supports maintaining the 350M ADA cap.\n⚖️ Balanced compromise: 300M ADA could be a pragmatic middle ground.\n\nFor funding proposals, our assessment will focus on:\nDoes it generate a return to the treasury?\nIs transparency and execution capacity ensured?\nDoes it set a strong precedent for the first year of decentralized financial governance?\n\nThe NCL is more than just a number — it reflects Cardano’s financial philosophy and growth trajectory. Changing the cap directly impacts which proposals are viable.\n\nWe’ll soon publish SIPO’s evaluation criteria and vote logic for each major proposal.

The result is less than ideal economical txns in DeFi.  \n\nAt the end of the day, the treasury can support with some measure of risk (not spend) here.  We cannot, imo, sit here and spend ADA for development and not provide an efficient high liquidity market for the developed apps and enhancements to thrive in.  \n\nThat said, while I’m favor, the 50M ask is bit too high given what has already been approved and expected for Intersects overall upcoming budget and the subsequent proposals we’re seeing come in. Given it’ll be the first time exploring liquidity injection and management of that process we should aim a bit lower, experimentally, 5-10-15M ADA maybe at most.

          "originalText": "VOTE ❌: Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Budget - 275M ada Administered by Intersect \n\n===================\nPlease redelegate to another DRep, if you disagree with my NO vote. If you redelegate to a YES voting DRep, it will count as a YES. \n===================\n\nRATIONALE\nI am voting NO on the proposed 2025 Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Budget because I believe the total amount requested is too high, especially  for the first year of minimum viable on-chain governance. \n\nI also believe that bundling 39 proposals together into a single vote limits DReps’ ability to express the differentiated support that we saw in earlier stages. This approach flattens nuance and imposes an all-or-nothing decision on a diverse set of funding priorities.\n\nI also acknowledge the existence of the three founding entities that were allocated Genesis ADA that are working with different levels of success to improve Cardano according to their original missions. Some of these missions have been nominally completed, some of these missions continue in their original form, some continue in a new form. I do not pretend to know all the nuances. \n\nStill I take that as a factor in my decision-making. Treasury funds should be used judiciously in complement and in awareness of the existence of the entities. \n\nThis vote against this Budget in its full size is based on:\n\n1. My participation in the DRep voting stage and the level of DRep participation as a whole;\n2. The level of support that some proposals received relative to others;\n3. The relative importance of certain proposals vs others and the quality of the teams and their dedication to Cardano’s mission;\n4. And the expectation that Catalyst will likely gain sufficient support (in this or future budget proposals) to continue to support smaller, experimental, or commercial projects.\n\nWhile spending from the Treasury is not new (Catalyst has done it before), this is the first major annual on-chain budget, and it sets a precedent.\n\nIn my view, the issue is not inflation within the Cardano economy — most ADA will not be used to buy NFTs or FTs. Nor is it simply about a slightly higher disinflation rate. The deeper issue is ADA devaluation due to external sell pressure. Most of the funded ADA will be exchanged for fiat (USD, EUR, etc.), not recycled internally. This adds downward pressure on ADA’s price.\n\nIt is a see-saw that has its quirks. \n\nIn a real-world economy, if you spend more to \"jumpstart\" the economy, face inflation if the supply of services and goods cannot meet demand. \n\nIn a still nascent blockchain economy, spending more essentially means converting the native token for fiat, and the result is devaluation. We are not exchanging ADA directly for Cardano economy goods and services, we are selling it into the real world. The ADA is not recycled internally. This adds downward pressure on ADA’s price.\n\nThis devaluation affects everyone:\n\n1. The most important funded projects\n2. The projects that were not funded\n3. The builders who didn’t ask for funding \n4. The ADA holders who fund all of it through opportunity cost\n\nOf course, that is unavoidable. Most of the ADA allocated will likely be converted to fiat (USD, EUR, etc.) to pay for services, not retained or reused within the ecosystem. This creates exchange rate pressure, weakening ADA’s value.\n\nThe question isn’t whether devaluation will occur — it will. The real question is: Where do we draw the line? Do all 39 proposals in this budget bring more value than the cost of the devaluation they collectively impose? Do we need to bundle them all in one YES/NO budget vote? I think No. \n\nWe are approving a large, externally-focused budget at a time when Cardano’s “blockchain economy” and governance mechanism is still immature and internally fragile.\n\nTreasury funds should primarily be focused on critical public goods in different forms. Especially if they are open source; support infrastructure, research, tools, even education, promotion of Cardano. This applies when the goods align with the long-term mission of Cardano as public infrastructure. Yes, there may be exceptions that emerge, but those exceptions are expensive — and others will pay for them.\n\nIf we overfund less impactful proposals, we risk undermining the impact of the most critical ones, simply by diluting the value of what they are paid in.\n\nFor this reason, I believe a smaller, phased budget focused tightly on foundational public goods would be a better and safer starting point.\n\nI include this rationale as an earnest view of the proposed budget action with the aim of contributing to the process by encouraging the submitter (Intersect) to take more factors into account."

This period is usually one year, which corresponds to 72 epochs.\n\nThe NCL can be defined as the amount of ADA for a given period. An alternative approach would be to express it as a percentage of Treasury revenue for a given past period.\n\nFor example, as 80% of Treasury revenue for the last 72 epochs.\n\nIt is up to the community to choose what they like best. \n\nThe first approach is more flexible because it is necessary to approve the NCL every year. The second approach could work in the long term without annual approval.\n\nThe NCL must be approved through governance action before it is possible to submit a proposal for withdrawal of ADA from the Treasury.\n\nThe NCL applies to all withdrawals from the Treasury in a given period.\n\nOnce the total number of ADA individually withdrawn from the Treasury reaches the defined NCL, further withdrawals exceeding the limit will become unconstitutional.\n\nThere is currently no NCL defined, so withdrawals are not possible.\n\nThere are two governance actions regarding NCL for next year.\n\nThe first one submitted by the community tries to set the NCL at 300M ADA. The second one from intersect sets 350M ADA.\n\nThere are currently 1.71B ADA in the Cardano Treasury.\n\nRevenues to the treasury consist of monetary expansion and fees. Fees are currently almost negligible. \n\nMost of the revenues consist of monetary expansion, i.e. the gradual transfer of ADA from the reserve to the Treasury.\n\nThere are currently 7.2B ADA in the reserve. The reserve is used to pay out staking rewards and deposit ADA into the Treasury.\n\nThe reserve is gradually trending towards 0. With each subsequent epoch, the reserve is decreasing. \n\nTreasury revenues will depend on fees and possibly other alternative revenues in the future.\n\nNCL is to prevent the rapid depletion of the Treasury, as ADA should be used to grow the ecosystem. \n\nBy this you can imagine a payment to IOG for the delivery of Ouroboros Leios, but also, for example, minting stablecoins. Basically, anything that the community approves.\n\nThere is a consensus that expenses should not be higher than Treasury revenues. NCL should reflect this. However, it is theoretically possible to approve NCL higher than Treasury revenues.\n\nAn important aspect of NCL is the direct negative impact on the market price of ADA. Entities that receive ADA from the Treasury can sell coins on the market to cover their living expenses.\n\nSelling pressure can harm SPOs and stakers.\n\nUltimately, this can also have a negative impact on Treasury, because if the market price of ADA is low in a bear market, it will be necessary to sell even more ADA in the coming years.\n\nIt is necessary to find a balance between the potential long-term positive impact of the investment and the medium-term market price of ADA.\n\nNCL does not mean that we have to spend a defined maximum. It is possible to approve an NCL of 350M ADA, but still, only 200M ADA can be approved in total spending in a given period.\n\nNCL is only an insurance against exceeding the limit. \n\nMore important are individual withdrawals. Each of them must be justified and we must be sure that the investment will have a positive impact on the ecosystem from the long-term perspective."

          "text": "8BALL Drep 已对 2025-2026 NCL 投了赞成票。\n\n对 2025-2026 NCL 信息行动投赞成票的理由。\n1. 肯定努力\n我想肯定那些在紧张的时间限制下，且几乎没有先例可循的情况下准备此信息行动的人们的努力。尽管该提案存在不足，但这份肯定是支撑我务实支持的基础。\n\n2. NCL 提款金额定义不清\n净变化限额 (NCL) 在 Cardano 宪法或提案中均未明确定义，这与社区对“净变化限额”的新兴理解有所不同。虽然这种缺乏明确性的问题很重要，但这并不足以成为拒绝该提案的理由。\n\n3. 门槛的合宪性\n提案规定需要获得活跃投票权益的 67% 才能通过。\n这引发了一个关于宪法TREASURY-01a 防护条款意图的问题，因为它没有明确说明 50% 的“门槛”值是防护条款身份的内在组成部分，还是仅仅是确定 NCL 提案是否达成一致的机制的一部分。\n\n具体来说，‘TREASURY-01a’是否意味着 NCL 需要得到超过 50% 活跃投票权益的批准，并将门槛作为防护条款的核心部分？还是说它意味着 NCL 必须超过至少 50% 的独立门槛，并根据提案的支持度在单独的步骤中进行衡量以确认一致？\n\n如果宪法的 50% 门槛是防护条款的内在组成部分，那么试图将门槛更改为 67% 可能会被视为违宪。但是，如果防护条款是一个独立的基准并且其条件得到满足，则该提案是合宪的，批准过程将继续。如果提案未能获得超过提案者设定的 67% 门槛的批准，则该提案无法达成一致。我相信允许高于 50% 的门槛可以增强治理的严谨性，并支持提案者设定它，因为他们可以设定投票期。然而，启用此功能需要修改宪法、更新分类帐规则和修订投票工具。因此，我接受投票必须超过 50% 才能就 NCL 达成一致。\n\n4. 支持文件的不可篡改性\n批准后编辑支持文件的能力构成了重大风险，可能损害提案的完整性。这个问题需要 Constitutional Committee 的关注，以强制执行不可篡改性并维护流程的可信度。\n\n5. 多年范围的担忧\n鉴于 Cardano 治理的当前成熟度，单年预算范围可能更合适，新的 NCL 提案可能会在 2026 年之前取代此提案。然而，2025 年预算最终确定的延迟使得将 2.5 亿 ADA 作为明年的 NCL 具有优势。这鼓励了更早开始 2026 年预算流程的讨论。我预计新的 2026 NCL 限额提案将取代此信息行动，但不会在 2025 年底之前。\n\n6. 预算期与时间表错位\n由于 2025 年第一季度已经过去，NCL 全年 3 亿 ADA 的价值引发了对过去工作可能存在的未申报补发款项的担忧，除非明确说明，否则我对此表示反对。NCL 应按比例反映正在资助的剩余时间表，以确保资源分配的准确性。\n\n7. 2025 年预算的迫切需求\n迫切需要一个预算上限来限制 2025 年路线图和预算的国库提款，包括 Ouroboros Leios 和 ZK 技术的工作。此限制必须在国库稳定与提高性能以保持 Cardano 竞争力的需求之间取得平衡。虽然提议的 3 亿 ADA 上限很高，但考虑到当前的预算讨论，这是可以接受的。\n\n8. NCL 价值对齐与预算审慎\nNCL 价值 (2025 年 3 亿 ADA 和 2026 年 2.5 亿 ADA) 与两年期间预计的国库流入量合理地保持一致。我更喜欢维持盈余的预算，尤其是在当前动荡的加密货币环境下。2025 年较低的 NCL (约 2 亿 ADA) 将反映预算流程的初期状态，加强审慎的货币政策，并减轻国库提款对 ADA 价格的负面影响。\n然而，预算决策的迫切需求优先于我对降低价值的偏好。\n\n9. 基于百分比的限制\n采用基于国库流入量的百分比限制可以增强可预测性，并作为简化未来预算流程的防护措施。\n\n10. 结论\n尽管在宪法要求方面存在不规范之处以及其他担忧，但 2025 年预算的迫切需求证明了忽视这些问题是合理的。虽然出于财政谨慎我会倾向于较低的 NCL 值，但通过预算的优先性迫使我投赞成票。Constitutional Committee 可以解决此处提出的问题，以完善治理实践。",

          "originalText": "8BALL Drep has voter YES to 2025-2026 NCL.\n\nRationale for Voting Yes to 2025-2026 NCL  InfoAction.\n1. Recognition of Effort\nI want to recognize the efforts of those who prepared this Info-Action under tight time constraints and with minimal precedent to guide them.\nThis acknowledgment underpins my pragmatic support for the proposal, despite its shortcomings.\n\n2. Unclear Definition of NCL Withdrawal Amount\nThe Net Change Limit (NCL) is not clearly defined in either the Cardano constitution or the proposal, diverging from the community’s emerging understanding of a \"net change limit.\" While this lack of clarity is significant, it does not warrant rejecting the proposal. \n\n3. Constitutionality of Threshold\nThe proposal specifies a 67% threshold of the active voting stake to pass. \nThis raises a question of the constitution's guardrail TREASURY-01a intent for it leaves unclear whether the \"threshold\" value of 50% is an intrinsic part of the \nguardrail’s identity or merely part of a mechanism to establish if the NCL proposal is agreed. \n\nSpecifically, does 'TREASURY-01a' mean an NCL requires approval by more than 50% of the active voting stake, with the threshold as a core part of the guardrail? Or does it imply the NCL must exceed a standalone threshold of at least 50%, with the proposal’s support measured against it in a separate step to confirm agreement?\"\n\nIf the constitution's 50% threshold is intrinsic to the guardrail, attempting to change the threshold to 67% could be deemed unconstitutional. \nHowever, if the guardrail is a standalone benchmark and its conditions are met the proposal is constitutional and the approval process continues.\nIf the proposal does not garner approval exceeding the proposer's threshold of 67% the proposal cannot be agreed.\nI believe allowing a threshold above 50% enhances governance rigor and support proposers setting it, as they can set the voting period. However, enabling this functionality would require amending the constitution, updating ledger rules, and revising voting tools. Thus, I accept that the vote must exceed only 50% to agree an NCL.\n\n4. Immutability of Supporting Documents\nThe ability to edit supporting documents after approval poses a significant risk, potentially undermining the proposal’s integrity. This issue requires attention from \nthe Constitutional Committee to enforce immutability and maintain trust in the process.\n\n5. Multi-Year Scope Concern\nGiven the current maturity of Cardano’s governance, a single-year budget scope might be more appropriate, with a new NCL proposal potentially superseding this proposal before 2026. However, the delay in finalizing the 2025 budget makes the inclusion of 250 million ada as next year's NCL advantageous. It encourages discussions for the2026 budget process earlier. I would expect a new 2026 NCL limit proposal to supercede this info action but not before the end of 2025. \n\n6. Budget Period and Timeline Misalignment\nWith the 2025 first quarter past, the NCL’s full-year value of 300 million ADA raises concerns about potential back payments for prior work, which I oppose unless explicitly specified. \nThe NCL should proportionally reflect the remaining timeline being funded to ensure accuracy in resource allocation.\n\n7. Urgent Need for a 2025 Budget\nA budget ceiling is urgently needed to cap treasury withdrawals for the 2025 roadmap and budget, including work on Ouroboros Leios and ZK technologies. This limit must balance treasury stability with the demand for improved performance to keep Cardano competitive. While the proposed 300 million ada maximum is high, it’s acceptable given current budget discussions.\n\n8. NCL Value Alignment and Budget Prudence\nThe NCL values (300 million ada for 2025 and 250 million for 2026) align reasonably with projected treasury inflows over the two-year period. I prefer budgets that maintain a surplus, especially given the current volatile cryptocurrency climate. A lower NCL for 2025, around 200 million ada, would reflect the nascent state of the budget process, reinforce prudent monetary policy and mitigate the negative effect on ada price by treasury withdrawls. \nHowever, the pressing need for a budget decision supersedes my preference for a reduced value.\n\n9. Percentage based limits\nAdopting percentage-based limits based on treasury inflows could enhance predictability and serve as guardrails to streamline future budget processes.\n\n10. Conclusion\nDespite irregularities in constitutional requirements, and other concerns, the urgent need for a 2025 budget justifies overlooking these issues. While I’d favor a lower NCL value out of fiscal caution, the priority of passing a budget compels me to vote YES. The Constitutional Committee can address the issues raised here to refine governance practices."

Instead, it establishes a cap on the total amount that can be withdrawn from the treasury across all budgets over a specific period—in this case, throughout 2025. I realize I’m being precise here, but with the existing confusion around governance in the community, I want to avoid any misunderstanding by others that could lead to an expectation of spending 300 million ADA this year."

          "text": "我投票反对 ⛔️ 将净变化限额 (NCL) 降至 200M ADA，这是迄今为止最艰难的治理决策之一。\n\n感觉这里似乎没有完全好的选择。\n\n而且，我自己也曾呼吁降低 NCL。\n\n当前 350M ADA 的 NCL 存在一些显著的缺陷。\n\n如果巨大的抛售压力导致 ADA 价格大幅下跌，比如跌至 0.2 USD，可能会带来严峻的挑战。\n\n以美元计算资助生态系统将需要从国库中出售大量 ADA，从而导致抛售压力的恶性循环，使情况进一步恶化。\n\nCardano Whale (@cardano_whale) 指出，像 Tezos 和 Polkadot 这样的一些项目在其生态系统中投入了大量资金，拥有创新技术，但仍难以获得实质性的关注。\n\n我完全同意这一点。\n\n对于区块链而言，保持在市值排名前 10 的位置至关重要。\n\n散户投资者、机构和加密货币爱好者不仅根据技术，还根据市场表现来评估项目。\n\n如果 Cardano 长期跌出前 10 名，无论其去中心化程度或像 Ouroboros Leios 这样的技术进步如何，它可能永远无法恢复其地位。\n\n这是一个需要考虑的重要因素，即使感觉不公平或主观。\n\n另一方面，将 NCL 降至 200M ADA 也有其自身的担忧。\n\nCardano 需要投资来推进其技术、支持建设者并发展生态系统。如果没有增加的用户活动，国库收入将不会增长。\n\n未来几年用于维护和开发的支出可能会耗尽储备金，最终使 Cardano 在经济上不可持续。\n\n协议的安全性也取决于有吸引力的权益奖励和激励措施。此外，如果没有活跃的开发者、工具和不断发展的 DeFi 生态系统，Ouroboros Leios 的潜力将无法发挥。在所有这些领域的投资都至关重要。\n\nIOG 已经明确了他们的资金需求：核心开发需要 96M ADA，Catalyst 需要 69M ADA，研究需要 27M ADA。总计 192M ADA。IOG 的提议很简单：要么批准这笔资金，要么就此作罢。\n\n关于公平性、IOG 和 Charles 过去的贡献以及 Cardano“完成”定义的辩论都有其道理，但现实是 IOG 在协议方面拥有无与伦比的专业知识。没有其他实体能够以同样的速度或质量有效地接管维护、开发和研究工作。\n\n如果 DReps 将 192M ADA 分配给 IOG，那么其他项目只剩下 8M ADA。\n\n在审查了预算提案后，我只支持了我认为生态系统绝对需要的那些基本项目：像 Midgard、Starstream、Hydra、ZK Rollups、Blockfrost、Lucid、Chainlink 集成等项目。\n\n仅就 CORE 类别而言，这大约相当于 12M ADA。在所有类别中，我批准的总预算为 213M ADA。\n\n鉴于我自己估计的所需支出为 213M ADA，我无法支持 200M ADA 的 NCL。\n\n这将与我在必要项目资金与我批准的上限方面的立场相矛盾。这种不一致性引导我决定投票反对降低 NCL。\n\nCardano 需要有效的营销和改进的治理支持，因为目前的情况远非理想。\n\n投资生态系统和推进新技术必须齐头并进，以确保可持续增长。\n\n在我看来，批准 200M ADA 的 NCL 将意味着维持现状，将所有关键责任留给 IOG，同时忽视对更广泛生态系统的投资。从本质上讲，这将限制对那些对生态系统至关重要的实体的资助，就像 IOG 一样。\n\n一个重要的考虑因素是围绕 NCL 的预期情景。\n\n在我看来，350M ADA 和 200M ADA 这两个 NCL 都是极端的。\n\n当前设定为 350M ADA 的 NCL 获得了强有力的支持，有 76% 的投票权益参与其中。几乎所有的投票权益都批准了它。将 NCL 从 350M 大幅削减至 200M ADA 要么是不负责任的，要么是过于雄心勃勃的。\n\n接下来会发生什么？建设者、Intersect、IOG 或其他人可能会提交一项新的治理行动，提议一个中间的 NCL，可能是 250M 或 300M ADA。或者，可能会同时提交多个提案。\n\n这种情况会造成一个不稳定的环境，这是适得其反且难以支持的。这种不稳定会破坏进展。\n\n此外，加密社区对 Cardano 生态系统能负担多少投资的冗长辩论兴趣不大。\n\n在不稳定的环境中，即使提出一个连贯的预算也几乎是不可能的。\n\n目前，我们的 NCL 是 350M ADA。考虑一下这个可能的情景：\n\nIntersect 预计将为 6 月份到期的预算提交一项治理行动。与此同时，如果到 5 月底批准了新的 200M ADA NCL，那么除非在新的 NCL 生效前获得批准，否则提议的预算实际上将变得违宪。\n\n这使流程复杂化，并进一步凸显了突然、极端变化带来的问题。\n\n通过治理行动来辩论 NCL 既低效又耗时。\n\n社区的共识似乎很可能在 250M 至 300M ADA 之间。然而，在链上投票之前没有进行过链下意向调查（大多数社区成员会对此做出回应），这导致当前的 NCL 仅仅是为了让预算流程得以继续而被批准。\n\nNCL 本身的概念开始让人觉得没有必要，因为它会根据多数票不断变化。如果投票权益同意增加或减少 NCL，这必然会发生。\n\n重要的是要强调，NCL 并不规定必须从国库中支出的金额。每一项提款提案仍然需要社区的批准。\n\n如果当前的提案在 250M 至 300M ADA 的范围内，我很可能会投赞成票。如果提交了这样的提案，我会支持它，因为它与我认为合理的、基于我已认可的提案的预算相符。\n\n然而，我的决定并非最终决定，可能会根据治理的未来发展而改变。\n\n例如，如果治理行动将多个提案合并导致总成本过高，或者如果 IOG 提案与几个我不支持的提案或我强烈反对的一个提案（例如 Daedalus 2025 服务增强）捆绑在一起，我可能会重新考虑我的立场。\n\n如果防止不良预算结果的唯一方法是投票支持较低的 NCL，我准备这样做。这个决定是微妙的，不能简单地用黑白来看待。\n\n我想避免出现批准较低 NCL 不可避免地导致另一次 GA 提交的情况。反复处理 NCL 问题既耗时又没有成效。\n\nDReps 需要优先处理预算提案。如果最终资助的是预算内低质量的项目，那么较高的 NCL 没有任何意义。\n\n我的 DRep ID：\ndrep1km69g7ksf8t5g0h9d9tkrcd2tezxelx0wtr76rv2mrkl5nzd6v3",

          "originalText": "I voted NO ⛔️to reduce the Net Change Limit (NCL) to 200M ADA, which has been one of the toughest governance decisions so far. \n\nIt feels like there’s no entirely good option here.\n\nMoreover, I myself called for a lower NCL.\n\nThe current NCL of 350M ADA has some notable drawbacks.\n\nIf high selling pressure causes ADA’s price to drop significantly, say to 0.2 USD, it could result in serious challenges. \n\nFunding the ecosystem in dollar terms would require selling a large amount of ADA from the treasury, leading to a spiral of selling pressure that could worsen the situation.\n\nCardano Whale (@cardano_whale) pointed out that some projects like Tezos and Polkadot have invested heavily in their ecosystems, possess innovative technologies, yet struggle to gain substantial attention.\n\nI fully agree with that.\n\nFor blockchains, maintaining a presence in the top 10 market capitalization rankings is vital.\n\nRetail investors, institutions, and crypto enthusiasts evaluate projects not only based on technology but also on market performance. \n\nIf Cardano drops out of the top 10 for an extended period, it may never regain its position, regardless of decentralization or technological progress like Ouroboros Leios. \n\nThis is an important factor to consider, even if it feels unfair or subjective.\n\nOn the other hand, reducing the NCL to 200M ADA comes with its own set of concerns.\n\nCardano needs investments to advance its technology, support builders, and develop the ecosystem. Without increased user activity, Treasury revenue won't grow. \n\nSpending on maintenance and development in the next years risks exhausting the reserve, ultimately making Cardano economically unsustainable.\n\nProtocol security also hinges on attractive staking rewards and incentives. Moreover, Ouroboros Leios’s potential will remain untapped without active developers, tools, and a growing DeFi ecosystem. Investments in all these areas are crucial.\n\nIOG has made their funding requirements clear: Core Dev needs 96M ADA, Catalyst 69M ADA, and Research 27M ADA. Combined, this totals 192M ADA. The offer from IOG is simple: either approve this funding or let it be.\n\nDebates around fairness, IOG and Charles’s past contributions, and the definition of “completion” for Cardano have their place, but the reality is that IOG holds unmatched expertise in the protocol. No other entity can effectively take over maintenance, development, and research at the same pace or quality.\n\nIf DReps allocate 192M ADA to IOG, only 8M ADA remains for other projects.\n\nAfter reviewing budget proposals, I supported only the essentials I believe the ecosystem absolutely needs: projects like Midgard, Starstream, Hydra, ZK Rollups, Blockfrost, Lucid, Chainlink integration, and others. \n\nFor the CORE category alone, this amounts to around 12M ADA. Across all categories, my total approved budget comes to 213M ADA.\n\nGiven my own estimate of required expenditures is 213M ADA, I cannot support an NCL of 200M ADA. \n\nIt would contradict my stance on necessary project funding versus the cap I approve. This inconsistency guided my decision to vote NO on reducing the NCL.\n\nCardano requires effective marketing and improved governance support, as the current situation is far from ideal.\n\nInvesting in the ecosystem and advancing new technologies must go hand in hand to ensure sustainable growth.\n\nApproving the NCL of 200M ADA, in my view, would mean preserving the status quo, leaving all key responsibilities to IOG while neglecting investment in the broader ecosystem. \n\nEssentially, it would restrict funding for entities that are vital to the ecosystem, just as IOG is.\n\nAn important consideration is the expected scenarios surrounding the NCL.\n\nBoth NCLs, an NCL of 350M ADA and 200M ADA, are extremes in my view.\n\nThe current NCL, set at 350M ADA, has strong support with 76% of the voting stake participating. Nearly the entire voting stake approved it. Drastically reducing the NCL from 350M to 200M ADA would be either irresponsible or overly ambitious.\n\nWhat would happen next? Builders, Intersect, IOG, or others would likely submit a new governance action proposing an intermediate NCL, perhaps 250M or 300M ADA. Alternatively, multiple proposals could be submitted simultaneously.\n\nThis scenario would create an unstable environment that is counterproductive and difficult to support. Such instability undermines progress.\n\nMoreover, the crypto community has little interest in prolonged debates about how much the Cardano ecosystem can afford to invest.\n\nIn an unstable environment, even proposing a coherent budget becomes nearly impossible.\n\nCurrently, we have an NCL of 350M ADA. Consider this likely scenario:\n\nIntersect is expected to submit a governance action for the budget expiring in June. Meanwhile, if a new NCL of 200M ADA is approved by the end of May, the proposed budget would effectively become unconstitutional unless it is approved before the new NCL takes effect. \n\nThis complicates the process and further highlights the issues with sudden, extreme changes.\n\nDebating the NCL through governance actions is both inefficient and overly time-consuming.\n\nIt seems likely that the community's consensus would fall somewhere between 250M–300M ADA. However, no off-chain temperature check was conducted (to which the majority of the community would respond) before the on-chain vote, which led to the current NCL being approved simply to allow the budgeting process to continue.\n\nThe concept of the NCL itself is starting to feel unnecessary, as it constantly shifts based on the majority vote. If the voting stake agrees to increase or decrease the NCL, it will inevitably happen.\n\nIt’s important to emphasize that the NCL doesn’t dictate the amount that must be spent from the treasury. Every withdrawal proposal still requires approval from the community.\n\nI would likely vote YES if the current proposal fell within the 250M–300M ADA range. If a proposal like this is submitted, I would support it, as it aligns with the budget I consider reasonable based on the proposals I have endorsed.\n\nHowever, my decision isn’t final and may change depending on future developments in governance. \n\nFor instance, if governance actions combine multiple proposals that result in an excessively high total cost, or if the IOG proposal is grouped with several proposals I don’t support, or one I strongly oppose, such as the Daedalus 2025 Service Enhancement, I might reconsider my stance.\n\nIf the only way to prevent a poor budget outcome is to vote for a lower NCL, I am prepared to do so. This decision is nuanced and cannot be seen in black-and-white terms.\n\nI want to avoid a scenario where approving a lower NCL inevitably results in another GA submission. Addressing the NCL repeatedly is time-consuming and unproductive. \n\nDReps need to prioritize budget proposals instead.\n\nA higher NCL serves no purpose if it ends up funding low-quality projects within the budget.\n\nMy DRep ID:\ndrep1km69g7ksf8t5g0h9d9tkrcd2tezxelx0wtr76rv2mrkl5nzd6v3"

Setting the NCL at 200M ADA would nearly exhaust the limit, leaving little room for funding other critical infrastructure proposals.

As we are still in the early stages of transitioning to on-chain governance, imposing a restrictive cap at this time could undermine the flexibility needed for effective decision-making and timely response.\n\nMoreover, the NCL is not fixed permanently once established. It should be subject to review and adjustment as budget execution progresses and as market conditions evolve.\n\nIn this transitional period, it is prudent to design with sufficient margin to accommodate uncertainty.

          "originalText": "As Cardano’s 2025 budget process gains momentum, multiple proposals have emerged to reassess the Net Change Limit (NCL). Here’s a breakdown of the current situation:\n\n✅ Approved: The 2025 NCL of 350M ADA has been formally ratified by DReps. It’s based on a 2024 treasury income model (approx. 336M ADA) and now serves as the foundation for current budget deliberations.\n\n❌ Rejected: A more conservative proposal to cap 2025 at 300M ADA and 2026 at 250M ADA was not approved.\n\n🟠 Under Review:\n“2025 Cardano NCL” proposes lowering the NCL to 200M ADA, urging a cautious approach during this first year of decentralized treasury governance.\n“300M ADA for Epochs 563–635” aims to establish an NCL for early 2026, supporting budget continuity across overlapping periods.\n\nMeanwhile, several new funding proposals have been submitted:\n\n1⃣ 7.5M ADA for Community Builder Proposals — includes only those with ≥2.69B ADA support, excluding proposals from Intersect and founding entities.\n\n2⃣ 1.5M ADA for Amaru Rust Node Development — a PRAGMA-led initiative to diversify Cardano nodes and enhance network resilience.\n\n3⃣ 50M ADA for DeFi Liquidity — aims to seed liquidity into DEXs and stablecoins, with yield partially returned to the treasury.\n\nAs SIPO DRep, we’re evaluating these developments based on:\n\n🔍 Cautious governance: supports the 200M ADA NCL.\n🚀 Growth & momentum: supports maintaining the 350M ADA cap.\n⚖️ Balanced compromise: 300M ADA could be a pragmatic middle ground.\n\nFor funding proposals, our assessment will focus on:\nDoes it generate a return to the treasury?\nIs transparency and execution capacity ensured?\nDoes it set a strong precedent for the first year of decentralized financial governance?\n\nThe NCL is more than just a number — it reflects Cardano’s financial philosophy and growth trajectory. Changing the cap directly impacts which proposals are viable.\n\nWe’ll soon publish SIPO’s evaluation criteria and vote logic for each major proposal. In the meantime, we welcome your input before the voting begins.\n\nIf you support our work as a DRep, please consider delegating:\n\nDRep ID:\ndrep1yffld2866p00cyg3ejjdewtvazgah7jjgk0s9m7m5ytmmdq33v3zh\n\nFor Daedalus:\ndrep120m237kstm7pzywv5nwtjm8gj8dl55j9nupwlkapz77mgv7zu7l"

          "text": "🚫我对由 Intersect 管理的 2.75 亿 ADA 的 Cardano 区块链生态系统预算投了反对票。\n\n理由：\n\n我强烈反对将所有提案捆绑在一个包里供 DReps 批准。\n\n关键提案与不太重要或不必要的提案混杂在一起，其中许多属于 Catalyst。\n\n预算责任要求对单个提案或较小的提案包做出决策，而不是一个大的提案包。\n\n提案细目：\n\n• 在 Ekklesia，我对总额为 2.133 亿 ADA 的 35 个提案投了赞成票——这比 Ekklesia 中 DRep 集体批准的预算低了 6200 万 ADA。\n\n• 我支持的六个提案有一个单独的 GA——这些是顶级项目，大多数 DReps 都认为会对生态系统产生积极影响。\n\n• Intersect 的 GA 包括我想支持的 19 个提案，总额为 2.042 亿 ADA，其中包括四个 IOG 项目，合并预算为 1.94 亿 ADA。\n\n• 同时，总额为 6550 万 ADA 的 14 个提案是我在 Ekklesia 中不支持的提案。\n\n假设 IOG 能够为其提案提交自己的 GA，我指的是支持总预算为 1000 万 ADA 的 15 个提案。\n\n与此相对的是预算为 6550 万 ADA 的 14 个我不想支持的提案。\n\n作为一名 DRep，我无法接受。\n\n就我而言，这种不平衡使得捆绑方式不可接受。我相信许多 DReps 也会为此苦恼。\n\n首选替代方案：\n\n我敦促团队提交自己的 GA 或要求 Intersect 按类别或门槛来组织提案。\n\n• 对单个提案进行链上投票是理想的，尽管 GA 提交需要 10 万 ADA 的保证金对许多项目来说是一个挑战。\n\n• 更小、更集中的 GA 提案包将有助于更好的决策。\n\n净变化限额 (NCL) 担忧：\n\n当前的 NCL 不明确，使得批准 2.75 亿 ADA 的预算为时过早。目前有两项关于 NCL 的有效 GA：\n\n1. 2 亿 ADA NCL，将于 2025 年 5 月 29 日到期。\n2. 3 亿 ADA NCL，将于 2025 年 6 月 8 日到期。\n\n现有的 NCL 获得了强有力的支持，但许多 DReps 可能仅仅是为了维持预算流程的进行而支持它，并非因为他们赞成高限额。\n\n在 DReps 就 NCL 达成一致之前，批准如此庞大的预算意义不大。\n\n此 GA 将于 2025 年 6 月 13 日到期。如果两项有效的 NCL GA 都失败，确认了当前的 NCL，我仍将有一个 epoch 的时间来重新考虑我的投票。\n\n后续步骤及我的立场：\n\n我敦促 DReps 尽快就 NCL GA 进行投票。\n\n我仍然认为，维持预算责任的最佳方式是对单个提案进行投票，而不是依赖 NCL。让我们在链上处理这个问题。\n\n我投反对票是向 Intersect 发出信号，表明我支持流程变更。我不想批准一个价值 2.75 亿 ADA 的大型提案包——我更喜欢单个投票或较小的提案包。\n\n然而，我对在 Ekklesia 中投赞成票的项目的支持仍然坚定。如果他们提交自己的 GA，我会投赞成票。\n\n只要是通过适当的 GA 提交，我也愿意重新考虑所有提案。\n\n最终，我认为理想的 NCL 应该在 2.5 亿 ADA 左右，并保留 1000 万 ADA 作为应急储备。\n\n平衡货币政策保护和生态系统投资是一项挑战——我们必须在资助增长的同时尽量减少抛售压力。\n\n解决方案是确保只有具有积极长期影响的项目才能从国库获得 ADA。\n\n在我看来，当前提案包中的一些提案是不必要的。\n\n我的 DRep ID：\ndrep1km69g7ksf8t5g0h9d9tkrcd2tezxelx0wtr76rv2mrkl5nzd6v3",

I believe that many DReps will struggle with this as well.\n\nPreferred Alternative:\n\nI urge teams to submit their own GAs or ask Intersect to structure proposals by category or threshold.\n\n• On-chain voting for individual proposals would be ideal, though the 100K ADA deposit for GA submissions is a challenge for many projects.\n\n• Smaller, more focused GA bundles would allow better decision-making.\n\nNet Change Limit (NCL) Concerns:\n\nThe current NCL is unclear, making a 275M ADA budget approval premature. There are two active GAs regarding NCL:\n\n1. 200M ADA NCL that expires May 29, 2025.\n2. 300M ADA NCL that expires June 8, 2025.\n\nThe existing NCL received strong support, but many DReps may have backed it simply to keep the budget process moving, not because they favored a high limit.\n\nUntil DReps align on the NCL, approving such a large budget makes little sense.\n\nThis GA expires June 13, 2025. If both active NCL GAs fail, confirming the current NCL, I will still have one epoch to reconsider my vote.\n\nNext Steps & My Position:\n\nI urge DReps to vote on the NCL GAs as soon as possible.\n\nI continue to believe that budgetary responsibility is best maintained by voting on individual proposals rather than relying on an NCL. Let’s handle this on-chain.\n\nMy NO vote is a signal to Intersect that I support a process change. I do not want to approve one large bundle worth 275M ADA—I prefer individual votes or smaller proposal bundles.\n\nHowever, my support for the projects I voted YES in Ekklesia remains firm. I will vote YES if they submit their own GA.\n\nI am also open to reconsidering all proposals, as long as they come through proper GA submissions.\n\nUltimately, I believe the ideal NCL should be around 250M ADA, with 10M ADA kept as a reserve for emergencies.\n\nBalancing monetary policy protection and ecosystem investment is a challenge—we must minimize selling pressure while funding growth.\n\nThe solution is ensuring that only projects with a positive long-term impact receive ADA from the Treasury.\n\nIn my view, some proposals in the current bundle are unnecessary.\n\nMy DRep ID:\ndrep1km69g7ksf8t5g0h9d9tkrcd2tezxelx0wtr76rv2mrkl5nzd6v3"

          "originalText": "VOTE ❌: Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Budget - 275M ada Administered by Intersect \n\n===================\nPlease redelegate to another DRep, if you disagree with my NO vote. If you redelegate to a YES voting DRep, it will count as a YES. \n===================\n\nRATIONALE\nI am voting NO on the proposed 2025 Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Budget because I believe the total amount requested is too high, especially  for the first year of minimum viable on-chain governance. \n\nI also believe that bundling 39 proposals together into a single vote limits DReps’ ability to express the differentiated support that we saw in earlier stages. This approach flattens nuance and imposes an all-or-nothing decision on a diverse set of funding priorities.\n\nI also acknowledge the existence of the three founding entities that were allocated Genesis ADA that are working with different levels of success to improve Cardano according to their original missions. Some of these missions have been nominally completed, some of these missions continue in their original form, some continue in a new form. I do not pretend to know all the nuances. \n\nStill I take that as a factor in my decision-making. Treasury funds should be used judiciously in complement and in awareness of the existence of the entities. \n\nThis vote against this Budget in its full size is based on:\n\n1. My participation in the DRep voting stage and the level of DRep participation as a whole;\n2. The level of support that some proposals received relative to others;\n3. The relative importance of certain proposals vs others and the quality of the teams and their dedication to Cardano’s mission;\n4. And the expectation that Catalyst will likely gain sufficient support (in this or future budget proposals) to continue to support smaller, experimental, or commercial projects.\n\nWhile spending from the Treasury is not new (Catalyst has done it before), this is the first major annual on-chain budget, and it sets a precedent.\n\nIn my view, the issue is not inflation within the Cardano economy — most ADA will not be used to buy NFTs or FTs. Nor is it simply about a slightly higher disinflation rate. The deeper issue is ADA devaluation due to external sell pressure. Most of the funded ADA will be exchanged for fiat (USD, EUR, etc.), not recycled internally. This adds downward pressure on ADA’s price.\n\nIt is a see-saw that has its quirks. \n\nIn a real-world economy, if you spend more to \"jumpstart\" the economy, face inflation if the supply of services and goods cannot meet demand. \n\nIn a still nascent blockchain economy, spending more essentially means converting the native token for fiat, and the result is devaluation. We are not exchanging ADA directly for Cardano economy goods and services, we are selling it into the real world. The ADA is not recycled internally. This adds downward pressure on ADA’s price.\n\nThis devaluation affects everyone:\n\n1. The most important funded projects\n2. The projects that were not funded\n3. The builders who didn’t ask for funding \n4. The ADA holders who fund all of it through opportunity cost\n\nOf course, that is unavoidable. Most of the ADA allocated will likely be converted to fiat (USD, EUR, etc.) to pay for services, not retained or reused within the ecosystem. This creates exchange rate pressure, weakening ADA’s value.\n\nThe question isn’t whether devaluation will occur — it will. The real question is: Where do we draw the line? Do all 39 proposals in this budget bring more value than the cost of the devaluation they collectively impose? Do we need to bundle them all in one YES/NO budget vote? I think No. \n\nWe are approving a large, externally-focused budget at a time when Cardano’s “blockchain economy” and governance mechanism is still immature and internally fragile.\n\nTreasury funds should primarily be focused on critical public goods in different forms. Especially if they are open source; support infrastructure, research, tools, even education, promotion of Cardano. This applies when the goods align with the long-term mission of Cardano as public infrastructure. Yes, there may be exceptions that emerge, but those exceptions are expensive — and others will pay for them.\n\nIf we overfund less impactful proposals, we risk undermining the impact of the most critical ones, simply by diluting the value of what they are paid in.\n\nFor this reason, I believe a smaller, phased budget focused tightly on foundational public goods would be a better and safer starting point.\n\nI include this rationale as an earnest view of the proposed budget action with the aim of contributing to the process by encouraging the submitter (Intersect) to take more factors into account."

Finally, using a conservative conversion rate of 0.5 ADA (`₳`) per USD (`$`) at the date of the withdrawal, we formulate a budget of **`₳1,500,000` (1.5M)**.\n\n> **NOTE**\n>\n> The Networking scope described in our [design documentation](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru/blob/main/engineering-decision-records/006-design-phase-documentation.md) is included in our proposal for reference but is already covered by a [Catalyst proposal](https://projectcatalyst.io/funds/12/cardano-open-developers/amaru-p2p-networking-component-by-txpipe). It is fully managed by Santiago.\n\n## Administration of the budget\n\nThe [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) maintainer committee will ensure **direct administration** of the budget, assisted with **an on-chain smart contract** (developed in open source, still incomplete, but aimed to be done and fully audited by the time of the first withdrawal).\n\nThe fund management, responsibilities and remuneration of contributors will follow PRAGMA's legal framework provided in annex under [PRAGMA Maintainer Committee Framework](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafkreiabxyva5lfm6zztg7tnktxvvbbucljrce7hlrp4p6hropqzfaip3y).\n\nIn addition, the smart contract's role is to ensure that the expenditure of funds is done in accordance with the scope defined in this budget and authorized by the relevant scope owners.\n\nWe recognize the following capabilities of this contract:\n\n1. **Standard withdrawal**: A scope owner asks other scope owners for money to be withdrawn from his scope.\n2. **Contingency withdrawal**: A scope owner asks other scope owners to withdraw an amount from the contingency funds.\n3. **Scope reconciliation**: A scope owner asks other scope owners for a change of ownership (or a reallocation of budget).\n4. **Contingency refund/closing**: scope owners ask to send the leftovers from the contingency budget to be sent back to the Cardano treasury.\n5. **Credential rotation**: In case of lost credentials or the departure of a scope owner, a mechanism allows the rotation of credentials to a new scope owner upon approval by all (5 out of 5) PRAGMA members (effectively capturing PRAGMA's board decision to appoint new maintainers).\n6. **Failsafe**: In the extreme scenario where credentials would be irremediably lost, thus preventing any further decision, a failsafe mechanism allows all unconsumed funds to be sent back to the Cardano treasury.\n\n## Reporting\n\n#### Quarterly reports\n\nFollowing [PRAGMA's Decision Record 006](https://github.com/pragma-org/PDRs/tree/main/PDR-0006-Project-Reporting), progress on [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) shall be **at least reported quarterly**. The content of [these reports](https://pragma.io/projects/amaru#quarterly-reports) is straightforward and includes the following:\n\n- Problems that require board attention (infrastructure, trademarks, etc.)\n- Project status (active, inactive, initiating, etc.)\n- A changelog (last committer addition)\n- Next planned steps (new releases, significant changes, etc.)\n- Reflection & Performances\n\nThis recurrent interaction will provide an overview of the project with a long-term perspective and support the maintainers' committee in aligning priorities and identifying the next steps. The outcome of these reviews will be publicly available as documentation in [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru)'s GitHub repository.\n\n#### Regular demos\n\nAmaru is demo-driven. We strive to integrate early and provide runnable examples showcasing the latest features as the project is being developed. The cadence for these demos is around 4 to 6 weeks, as illustrated on the [existing track record](https://pragma.io/projects/amaru#demos).\n\nWe will naturally continue to **record and post demos regularly**.\n\n## Constitutionality checklist\n\nBeing one of the first proposals of this nature ever submitted, it is easy to get things wrong. In an effort to convince ourselves of its constitutionality, we thought relevant to include a checklist of the points we cover and for each, our interpretation of the Cardano Constitution.\n\n#### Purpose\n\n- [x] This proposal is for work intended to enhance the security, decentralization and long-term sustainability of Cardano.\n\n#### Article III.5: the process of on-chain governance\n\n- [x] We have submitted this proposal in a standardized, legible format, which includes a URL and hash of all documented off-chain content. We believe our rationale to be detailed and sufficient. The proposal contains a title, abstract, reason for the proposal and relevant supporting materials.\n\n#### Article IV.1: proposing budgets\n\n- [x] This proposal accords with the provisions of this article as it is intended to cover the maintenance and future development of the Cardano Blockchain.\n\n- [x] This proposal covers a shorter period than 73 epochs, which is permitted in this section of the Constitution, to match the Net-Change Limit period.\n\n#### Article IV.2: funds administration\n\n- [x] This proposal specifies an administrator in accordance with this provision. It also specifies an internal administration process using smart contracts and an off-chain overseeing committee, meeting the requirements of this clause, which requires a process that may include an administrator.\n\n#### Article IV.3: Net-Change Limit\n\n- [x] Being of ₳1.5M and covering the second half of 2025, this proposal and the treasury withdrawals it would enable do not violate the currently agreed upon Net-Change Limit.\n\n#### Article IV.4: Auditor\n\n- [x] This proposal makes provisions for an auditor (covered by the _Ad-hoc mercenaries_ scope).\n\n#### Guardrails\n\n- [x] This proposal is subject to _TREASURY-04a_ in that it defines a Cardano blockchain ecosystem budget. It requires a threshold greater than 50% of the DReps' active voting stake to be considered approved and enable subsequent withdrawals pertaining to this budget.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) project represents a major step towards node diversity through the development of a modular, high-performance, and interoperable block-producing node for Cardano. Our approach, rooted in openness, innovation, and operational resilience, aims to deliver significant advancements in blockchain technology without compromising on security.\n\nIn addition to this budget, we provide a detailed document outlining:\n\n- explicit assumptions about the project, the valuation and the scopes covered;\n- comparisons to similar projects of developing blockchain nodes; and\n- the methodology used for managing the project, its deliveries, its finance and its governance.\n\nThrough rigorous design and execution phases, we have outlined actionable scopes, realistic timelines, and comprehensive resource allocations. The detailed breakdown of scopes, funding and resources already secured reflects our commitment to transparency and efficiency. While we remain optimistic about our forecasts, we acknowledge the complexities involved and have incorporated contingencies to address unforeseen challenges.\n\nMore than a mere budget, this proposal is an invitation to collaborate and innovate together. The [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) project is ambitious yet achievable through the collective effort of our contributors and the broader Cardano community. By focusing on building, learning, and demonstrating tangible progress, [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) paves the way for a more resilient and decentralized Cardano ecosystem, ensuring long-term reliability and innovation.\n\nLet's build the future of Cardano together.",
          "motivation": "## Who we are\n\n[Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) is a multi-entity effort that currently sits under [PRAGMA](https://pragma.io): a member-based, not-for-profit open-source association for blockchain software projects. Five members with equal power currently drive PRAGMA's strategy and operations: Blink Labs, Cardano Foundation, dcSpark, Sundae Labs, and TxPipe. Each of them has a proven track record of building on Cardano and supporting our ecosystem.\n\n[Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) itself is managed by an appointed maintainer committee in charge of different scopes. The current maintainer committee comprises of:\n\n- [Arnaud Bailly](https://github.com/abailly) responsible for the consensus and simulation testing.\n- [Matthias Benkort](https://github.com/ktorz) responsible for the ledger & overall architecture.\n- [Pi Lanningham](https://github.com/Quantumplation) responsible for the ad hoc work and middleware integrations.\n- [Santiago Carmuega](https://github.com/scarmuega) responsible for the p2p networking.\n- [Damien Czapla](https://github.com/Dam-CZ) responsible for the project management, public relations & marketing.\n\nEach member of the maintainer committee is in charge of a scope and has oversight on its delivery, which includes managing an associated budget.\n\n## Why build another node\n\nOne of Cardano's key assets is its legendary robustness and stability, which is mainly attributed to the existing Haskell node, which has been working without significant disruption for about five years now (counting since the Byron reboot, circa February 2020).\n\nSo why bother with another node? The answer is, of course, plural:\n\n#### 1. **Better resource usage**\n\nSoftware is ultimately a collection of design decisions and trade-offs. Some of those trade-offs in the Haskell node have led to rather high resource usages (e.g., resident memory), thus leading to the creation of specific protocol parameters (e.g., min-utxo-value) as countermeasures to ensure resource usage remains somewhat bounded. Our analysis is that different (albeit acceptable) trade-offs would yield better resource usage.\n\n#### 2. **Industry-grade observability**\n\nObservability is challenging, and it is even more so when rolling your own solution. With [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru), we intend to embrace industry standards for monitoring, tracing, and logging to drastically enhance the user experience for operators seeking insights into their node's behaviour.\n\n#### 3. **Enhanced interoperability**\n\n[Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) being primarily written in Rust means that we can more easily leverage an existing and thriving ecosystem of blockchain solutions and aim at multiple target platforms (e.g. web-assembly, RISC-V). This opens up not only to a wide variety of potential contributors but also to many new use cases that are much harder (not to say unrealistic) to achieve with a Haskell node.\n\n#### 4. **Higher-assurance & robustness**\n\nDeveloping a new implementation of existing software means dissecting every part of the original implementation. Along the way, bugs and discrepancies with the specification are commonly found through conformance testing. Gaps in the documentation can also be identified and addressed. The development of [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) has already proven this on several occasions. In the long run, more node implementations can be a synonym for reduced development time by allowing all implementations to converge faster towards better designs and more robust implementations.\n\n#### 5. **Decentralization**\n\nIn a world where Byzantine fault tolerance is at the centre and where decentralization is a paramount value, we believe that a single-node implementation presents a single point of failure and a central point of control. A new node not only increases the overall resilience of the network but also provides perspectives in terms of a roadmap and use cases.\n\n---\n\nWith [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru), we believe that we can reconcile these goals while preserving Cardano's focus on security and robustness. Like Haskell, Rust is a statically typed language that provides strong compile-time guarantees and fine-grained memory management. Its ecosystem is also well-equipped for high assurance, making it a sane choice for implementing blockchain solutions.",

        "rationale": "## Executive summary\n\n> **NOTE**\n>\n> All the scopes described are estimated in FTE (Full Time Employee) valued at $200k per annum.\n\n[Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) is an ongoing project that is already a few months old, and resources have initially been allocated to bootstrap its development. Given the core nature of [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) and in order to avoid becoming financially dependent on a single entity for its development, we are seeking **₳1.5M** of additional funding for the **second half of 2025**.\n\nThe table below breaks down the current/estimated effort, the fraction of resources already secured from other sources of funding, and the resources needed. It covers the whole of 2025.\n\n| Scope                                            | Owner    | Estimated effort | Resources already secured | Resources needed |\n| ---                                              | ---      | ---              | ---                       | ---              |\n| Ledger                                           | Matthias | 2.5 FTEs         | 1 FTE                     | 1.5 FTEs         |\n| Consensus and simulation                         | Arnaud   | 2.5 FTEs         | 1 FTE                     | 1.5 FTEs         |\n| Networking                                       | Santiago | 1 FTE            | 1 FTE                     | 0 FTEs           |\n| Ad-hoc Mercenaries                               | Pi       | 2.5 FTEs         | 0 FTEs                    | 2.5 FTEs         |\n| Project Management, Public Relations & Marketing | Damien   | 0.5 FTEs         | 0 FTEs                    | 0.5 FTEs         |\n\nThe total resources without funding for 2025 adds up to **6 FTEs**. Considering this budget ask is only for **the second half of 2025**, it halves to `$600,000` (600K) once converted to USD (`$`). We then add a 25% contingency budget to cope with our optimistic bias: we are aware that our forecast is subject to underestimating complexity, overlooking challenges, and undervaluing the time and cost required to deliver.\n\nWith this contingency, we end up at **`$750,000` (750K)**. Finally, using a conservative conversion rate of 0.5 ADA (`₳`) per USD (`$`) at the date of the withdrawal, we formulate a budget of **`₳1,500,000` (1.5M)**.\n\n> **NOTE**\n>\n> The Networking scope described in our [design documentation](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru/blob/main/engineering-decision-records/006-design-phase-documentation.md) is included in our proposal for reference but is already covered by a [Catalyst proposal](https://projectcatalyst.io/funds/12/cardano-open-developers/amaru-p2p-networking-component-by-txpipe). It is fully managed by Santiago.\n\n## Administration of the budget\n\nThe [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) maintainer committee will ensure **direct administration** of the budget, assisted with **an on-chain smart contract** (developed in open source, still incomplete, but aimed to be done and fully audited by the time of the first withdrawal).\n\nThe fund management, responsibilities and remuneration of contributors will follow PRAGMA's legal framework provided in annex under [PRAGMA Maintainer Committee Framework](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafkreiabxyva5lfm6zztg7tnktxvvbbucljrce7hlrp4p6hropqzfaip3y).\n\nIn addition, the smart contract's role is to ensure that the expenditure of funds is done in accordance with the scope defined in this budget and authorized by the relevant scope owners.\n\nWe recognize the following capabilities of this contract:\n\n1. **Standard withdrawal**: A scope owner asks other scope owners for money to be withdrawn from his scope.\n2. **Contingency withdrawal**: A scope owner asks other scope owners to withdraw an amount from the contingency funds.\n3. **Scope reconciliation**: A scope owner asks other scope owners for a change of ownership (or a reallocation of budget).\n4. **Contingency refund/closing**: scope owners ask to send the leftovers from the contingency budget to be sent back to the Cardano treasury.\n5. **Credential rotation**: In case of lost credentials or the departure of a scope owner, a mechanism allows the rotation of credentials to a new scope owner upon approval by all (5 out of 5) PRAGMA members (effectively capturing PRAGMA's board decision to appoint new maintainers).\n6. **Failsafe**: In the extreme scenario where credentials would be irremediably lost, thus preventing any further decision, a failsafe mechanism allows all unconsumed funds to be sent back to the Cardano treasury.\n\n## Reporting\n\n#### Quarterly reports\n\nFollowing [PRAGMA's Decision Record 006](https://github.com/pragma-org/PDRs/tree/main/PDR-0006-Project-Reporting), progress on [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) shall be **at least reported quarterly**. The content of [these reports](https://pragma.io/projects/amaru#quarterly-reports) is straightforward and includes the following:\n\n- Problems that require board attention (infrastructure, trademarks, etc.)\n- Project status (active, inactive, initiating, etc.)\n- A changelog (last committer addition)\n- Next planned steps (new releases, significant changes, etc.)\n- Reflection & Performances\n\nThis recurrent interaction will provide an overview of the project with a long-term perspective and support the maintainers' committee in aligning priorities and identifying the next steps. The outcome of these reviews will be publicly available as documentation in [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru)'s GitHub repository.\n\n#### Regular demos\n\nAmaru is demo-driven. We strive to integrate early and provide runnable examples showcasing the latest features as the project is being developed. The cadence for these demos is around 4 to 6 weeks, as illustrated on the [existing track record](https://pragma.io/projects/amaru#demos).\n\nWe will naturally continue to **record and post demos regularly**.\n\n## Constitutionality checklist\n\nBeing one of the first proposals of this nature ever submitted, it is easy to get things wrong.

It also specifies an internal administration process using smart contracts and an off-chain overseeing committee, meeting the requirements of this clause, which requires a process that may include an administrator.\n\n#### Article IV.3: Net-Change Limit\n\n- [x] Being of ₳1.5M and covering the second half of 2025, this proposal and the treasury withdrawals it would enable do not violate the currently agreed upon Net-Change Limit.\n\n#### Article IV.4: Auditor\n\n- [x] This proposal makes provisions for an auditor (covered by the _Ad-hoc mercenaries_ scope).\n\n#### Guardrails\n\n- [x] This proposal is subject to _TREASURY-04a_ in that it defines a Cardano blockchain ecosystem budget. It requires a threshold greater than 50% of the DReps' active voting stake to be considered approved and enable subsequent withdrawals pertaining to this budget.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) project represents a major step towards node diversity through the development of a modular, high-performance, and interoperable block-producing node for Cardano.

        "summary": "Amaru 節點開發2025提案旨在為2025年下半年尋求150萬₳的資金，用於開發 Amaru——一個為 Cardano 設計的開源、基於 Rust 的替代性出塊節點。該計畫由 PRAGMA 主導，這是一個由 Cardano 生態系統中已建立的實體組成的聯盟。其預期目標是透過引入用戶端多樣性、減少對主要基於 Haskell 的節點的依賴，並透過 Rust 吸引更廣泛的開發者群體，來增強 Cardano 網路的彈性、去中心化程度和效能。在當前競爭格局下，網路效能和去中心化是關鍵的差異化因素，此舉措符合 Cardano 發展其技術基礎設施的戰略重點，特別是在核心協議穩健性和開發者生態系統擴展方面。",
        "myOpinion": "我強烈支持 Amaru 節點開發2025提案。它直接解決了一個成熟區塊鏈的基本需求：用戶端多樣性。這不僅僅是一個「錦上添花」的功能，而是增強網路安全、抵禦錯誤或攻擊的彈性以及實現真正去中心化的關鍵組成部分，從而擺脫對單一核心用戶端的依賴。選擇 Rust 是具有前瞻性的，可能會擴大 Cardano 的開發者社群，並可能帶來效能優勢。PRAGMA 的參與大大增強了其可信度。對於這樣一個重要且具有潛在影響力的計畫來說，所請求的預算是適度的。雖然維護多個用戶端的技術挑戰是真實存在的，但對於一個渴望成為全球金融和社交作業系統的平台來說，這是必要的複雜性。增強的穩健性、降低的系統性風險以及更有活力的開發者生態系統所帶來的好處，遠遠超過了可管理的成本和技術協調開銷。該提案與 Cardano 創建一個安全、可持續和高效區塊鏈的長期戰略目標完美契合，投資於像 Amaru 這樣的關鍵基礎設施的高品質工程至關重要。"

My reasons for this are well documented, but primarily relate to the emissions-price pressure-value add relationships.\n\nCore dev\nA reasonable proposal by IOG to keep delivering on critical roadmap items would get my instant support. In my view the one we have seen on gov tools ticks that box, if with a slightly hefty ask. Also assuming no surprises, I’d approve associated forks and changes. \n\nI am aware others besides IOG could do some of the work, but I think a safe approach in the first years of governance would be to only gradually diversify the work beyond IOG, rather than pull away from them immediately.

Catalyst is a system that is not perfect, but is improving (eg quadratic voting) and is the current best framework we have for such things. Intersect might complement this, but needs to prove itself.\n\nSummary\nThis covers core tech, non core tech innovation, orgs and all the other proposals via Intersect/Catalyst.\n\nI think at a high level it should in principle be possible to fit all the above into a NCL of 150m ADA, though that would require some frugality on the part of all participants.\n\nMy stance on governance is that it should be transparent and on-chain wherever possible. I am currently unsure whether the Intersect budget process is as robust as what we have in place with Catalyst, and in any case it would need to prove itself.\n\nTherefore my preference would be to pull some of the tech related ones that I mentioned out of this process, and put them to a direct DRep vote fairly soon. Shrink down both Catalyst/Intersect budgets significantly and put them to a vote. I’ll likely support them."

          "originalText": "@JaromirTesar \n\nScalability and Funding - Plan is still the same.  Last I checked both Midgard and IOG teams are still making good progress on things, despite the fact that we have not withdrawn from the Cardano treasury in a very long time.  I don't think another 6 weeks while we pursue a better will slow progress meaningfully.\n\nCatalyst Funding - I'm not aware of these ecosystem teams that are \"fighting for survival\".  Catalyst has already been funded up through F13.  And how would any of these projects know that they would be approved for funding anyways?  IMHO a 6-week delay is perfectly fine.\n\nFlexibility of Governance - I'm aware that a new NCL can be passed that is lower.  However, I worry that once we have a high NCL passed, many of the top dReps who happen to have budget proposals will rigorously defend the high limit so that their proposals have a better chance.  Better to approve a low NCL and then raise it later if we have to IMHO.\n\nMarket Timing and Investment Windows - I don't think any of the budget proposals mentioned so far move the needle enough in a positive direction to be worth the ADA they are asking for.  What is the PMF we are trying to market?  What strategic initiatives other than ones in IOG's core proposal, Midgard, Starstream, Amaru, and Gerolamo are needed?  All of those combined are still less than 200M ADA.  Also, I support a stablecoin liquidity proposal, but it needs to be decoupled from Emurgo's omnibus proposal IMHO.\n\nChecks and Balances - The issue here is not necessarily that dReps will want to spend up to the cap.  It's that budget proposers will.  We don't have enough visibility into ANY of the proposals' true costs.  Example:  Maybe with a 150M NCL, IOG might propose 50M for their core proposal.  With 350M NCL, there is enough room for them to ask for 100M first just to see if it passes.  We WANT budget proposers to be *LIMITED* by the NCL to get them to compete to lower costs.\n\nMisuse Isn’t Solved by NCL Alone - Agreed.  But IMHO lowering the NCL will cause proposers to increase the *quality* of their proposals in order to compete with other proposers for a slice of a smaller pie.\n\nSelling Pressure and Timing - ADA is currently 5x below ATH.  I very much doubt that it will be on its way back down again 6 weeks from now.  In fact I think if we delay a little bit we'll be more likely to stretch the value of our ADA spent to go much further.\n\nThese are some of the main reasons I am strongly against approving a 350M NCL right now."

          "text": "我的預算提案理由\n\n我支持了23個計畫，總計2.222億 ADA。我對所有其他計畫都投了反對票。\n\n各類別支持的計畫數量：\n\n• 核心：17\n• 研究：2\n• 行銷與創新：2\n• 治理支持：2\n\n我支持的3個最大計畫是 IOG 核心開發、IO 研究和 Catalyst。\n\n這3個計畫佔了1.93億 ADA。\n\n我曾猶豫是否支持 IOG 研究。過去發表了許多學術論文。我們明年的研究計畫清單並非都需要。現在有必要更多地支持實施和生態系統，在我看來，這方面落後於研究。\n\n另一方面，Cardano 的成功在很大程度上基於研究和使用形式化方法的高品質實施。\n\n不支持研究將是一個倒退。清單上的一些東西將來可能會實施。\n\n我下次的建議是為每個計畫創建單獨的提案，而不是一個包含許多計畫的提案。這也適用於核心開發。\n\n正如我之前提到的，我認為 Catalyst 是大多數計畫應該申請資金的地方。所以我支持它。\n\n在審查預算提案期間，我注意到在許多情況下，只有大約2-3名 DReps 投票。在最好的情況下，大約10名，很少有20名左右。這是一個非常低的參與率。\n\nCatalyst 並不完美，但它已經改進了好幾年，團隊經驗豐富，而且它是一個經過實戰檢驗的工具。ADA 持有者已經熟悉該系統。此外，還計畫進行進一步的改進。\n\n目前，我認為沒有理由用預算提案取代 Catalyst。\n\n我的另一個建議是，一旦 NCL 獲得批准，IOG 應該為其提案提交單獨的 GA。這將避免 DReps 在一個 GA 中對包含許多其他計畫的 GA 進行投票的情況。\n\n我只用了2900萬 ADA 來支持其他23個計畫。\n\n在我看來，這些是生態系統迫切需要的計畫。\n\n我認為 Midgard、Starstream、Hydra、ZK Rollups、一個替代的 Cardano 節點、與 Bitcoin 的整合以及其他幾個計畫都是必須擁有的計畫。\n\n如果我遇到多個類似的提案，我更喜歡開源計畫和社群熟知的實體，或者那些已經交付了至今仍在使用的計畫的實體。\n\n我想強調的是，如果我投了反對票，可能意味著：\n\n• 我不喜歡這個計畫。它不應該從財政庫（或 Catalyst）獲得資金。\n\n• 我喜歡這個計畫，它應該向 Catalyst 申請資金。\n\n總的來說，我認為有商業成功雄心的計畫應該尋找其他資金來源。\n\n我不喜歡風險業務由財政庫資助，而在成功的情況下利潤被私有化的情況。\n\n如果計畫申請財政庫資金，它們應該制定一個策略，在成功的情況下將部分利潤返還給社群。\n\n此外，我認為如果是一家新創公司，團隊不能指望開發人員能拿到和 IOG 開發人員一樣的薪水。部分風險必須由團隊承擔，而不僅僅是財政庫。\n\n有些計畫沒有商業性質，例如函式庫、開發工具等。我們應該識別這些計畫，評估它們的益處，並可能支持它們。\n\n我支持的最後一個主要計畫是 Cardano 基金會的行銷策略。這也包括 Cardano 高峰會。\n\n總的來說，我不希望支持那些持有 Genesis 代幣但尚未使用的創始實體的計畫。Cardano 基金會就是這樣的實體，這在上一期 Catalyst 基金中得到了負面反映。\n\n另一方面，這個提案是行銷類別中最好的。Cardano 基金會支持生態系統中的許多活動。CF 希望長期保持活躍並支持生態系統建設，為此它需要獲得資金。\n\nCardano 高峰會和其他行銷活動的成本可能很高。我不希望冒這樣的風險：如果他們的提案未獲批准，下一屆 Cardano 高峰會將無法舉辦。加密產業可能會對此產生負面看法。\n\n我只支持了 Intersect 關於開源開發預算的一項提案。他們要求580萬 ADA。\n\n每天都有新的提案出現，所以我的決定可能不是最終的。我可能會做出改變。\n\n我的 DRep ID：\ndrep1km69g7ksf8t5g0h9d9tkrcd2tezxelx0wtr76rv2mrkl5nzd6v3",

Now it is necessary to support implementation and the ecosystem more, which, in my opinion, is lagging behind research.\n\nOn the other hand, Cardano's success is largely based on research and quality implementation using formal methods. \n\nNot supporting research would be a step aside. Some of the things on the list may be implemented in the future.\n\nMy recommendation for next time is to create a separate proposal for each item instead of one proposal with many items. This also applies to Core development.\n\nAs I mentioned before, I consider Catalyst to be the place where most projects should apply for funding. That is why I support it.\n\nDuring the review of Budget Proposals, I noticed that in many cases, only about 2-3 DReps voted. In the best case, about 10, rarely around 20. This is a very low participation.\n\nCatalyst is not perfect, but it has been improved for several years, the team is experienced, and it is a battle-tested tool. ADA holders are already familiar with the system. Moreover, further improvements are planned.\n\nAt this point, I see no reason to replace Catalyst with Budget Proposals.\n\nMy other recommendation is that IOG should submit separate GAs for their proposals once the NCL is approved. This will avoid the situation where DReps vote on a GA with many other items in one GA.\n\nI only used 29M ADA to support the other 23 projects. \n\nThese are projects that, in my opinion, the ecosystem desperately needs.\n\nI consider Midgard, Starstream, Hydra, ZK Rollups, an alternative Cardano node, integration with Bitcoin, and several others to be must-have projects.\n\nIf I came across multiple similar proposals, I preferred open-source projects and entities that are well-known to the community or have delivered a project that is still in use today.\n\nI would like to emphasize that if I voted NO, it could mean:\n\n• I don't like the project. It shouldn't be funded from Treasury (or Catalyst).\n\n• I like the project, and it should apply for funding from Catalyst.\n\nIn general, I think that projects with ambitions to be commercially successful should look for other sources of funding. \n\nI don't like it when a risky business is funded from the Treasury, and in case of success, the profit is privatized.\n\nIf projects apply for Treasury funding, they should have a strategy on how to return part of the profit back to the community in case of success.\n\nFurthermore, I think that if it is a startup, the team cannot expect that devs will be paid the same salaries as IOG devs. Part of the risk must be borne by the team, not just Treasury.\n\nSome projects do not have a commercial character, for example, libraries, dev tools, etc. We should identify these projects, evaluate their benefits, and possibly support them.\n\nThe last major project I supported was the Marketing Strategy from the Cardano Foundation. This also includes the Cardano Summit.\n\nIn general, I do not want to support projects from founding entities that hold Genesis coins and have not spent them yet. The Cardano Foundation is such an entity, which was negatively reflected in the last Catalyst Fund.\n\nOn the other hand, this proposal was the best in the marketing category. The Cardano Foundation supports many activities in the ecosystem. CF wants to remain active in the long term and support building the ecosystem, for which it needs to secure funding.\n\nThe costs of the Cardano Summit and other marketing activities can be high. I would not like to risk that if their proposal is not approved, the next Cardano Summit will not be organized. The crypto industry could perceive this negatively.\n\nI have only supported a single proposal from Intersect regarding the budget for open-source development. They are asking for 5.8M ADA.\n\nNew proposals appear every day, so my decision may not be final.  I may make changes.\n\nMy DRep ID:\ndrep1km69g7ksf8t5g0h9d9tkrcd2tezxelx0wtr76rv2mrkl5nzd6v3"

          "originalText": "My Vote on the Intersect Budget Temp Check 🗳️\n\nAs part of my responsibilities as a DRep, I would like to share my rationale for my votes. I’ll keep this explanation straightforward, especially for those who may not be deeply involved yet in Cardano governance.\n\nWhat I Voted For\n\nI am supporting funding in the following strategic areas:\n\n- Zero Knowledge (ZK) Solutions (zkFold, ZK Bridge, Atlas PAB Hydra Integrations, etc.)\n\n- Cardano Node Development and Maintenance (Core Engineering, Rust Nodes, Maintenance Proposals)\n\n- Libraries and Developer Tooling (Pallas, MLabs Libraries, Extended Symbolic, Lucid, etc.)\n\n- Bitcoin Interoperability (Complete Web3 stack for Cardano-Bitcoin bridge)\n\n- Layer 2 Scaling Solutions (Midgard Rollups, Hydra integrations)\n\nReflections and Honest Assessment\n\nI want to be honest: I could not deeply analyze every single proposal.\n\nI focused primarily on:\n\n- Proposals from well-recognized teams in the ecosystem\n\n- Proposals I was directly asked to analyze\n\n- Proposals aligned with my beliefs of Cardano’s current priorities\n\nGiven the sheer volume (almost 200 proposals) and the limited time and support tools we currently have as DReps, this was an intense and imperfect process.\nIf you think I missed an important proposal, feel free to DM me — I’m happy to review it again.\n\nBudget Distribution Summary\n\n- CORE: 190,222,949 - 55.11%\n- Research: 29,598,000 - 8.57%\n- Gov-Support: 111,643,123 - 32.34%\n- Marketing: 94,623,933 - 27.41%\n- None: 766,800 - 0.22%\n\nTotal: 345,161,209 ADA\n\nWhy So Much Into Marketing?\n\nSome may ask why I supported significant marketing budgets.\n\nMy view is pragmatic:\n\nCardano is not a government, it's closer to a startup at this stage.\n\nIn a highly competitive crypto environment, growth is critical.\n\nAccumulating millions of ADA in treasury means little if we do not reinvest part of it in ecosystem expansion.\n\nI would support smaller marketing budgets in future rounds, but missing the 2025-2026 cycle would be a major strategic mistake.\n\nConclusion: Focus Areas for Next Year\n\nDReps must be compensated for the massive amount of work required. If not, simply DReps will not participate\n\nBetter tooling, AI support, and proposal management platforms are mandatory.\n\nCatalyst and Constitutional Governance must be better integrated, not siloed.\n\nThank you to everyone who submitted proposals, participated in discussions, and helped in this massive effort. We are still at the beginning — but it’s a promising one.\n\nIF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A DREP MY ID IS: drep1y2jd3c4hgg0tdua58z6c64k9rf58lz3jlcjlxcjfeaspl6q2e9zm6\n\nProposals I voted YES for: \n\n- Cardano Maintenance and Roadmap Delivery Proposal: Secure Ada Network Infrastructure for the enTire cardano communitY\n- Input Output Research (IOR): Cardano Vision - Work Program 2025\n- A member-based organization for the Cardano ecosystem: Intersect\n- Beyond Minimum Viable Governance: Iteratively Improving on Cardano Voltaire\n- The Cardano community's open-source tool for participation in its governance: Cardano Govtool\n- Cardano Product Committee: Community-driven - 2030 Cardano Vision and 2026 roadmap insights collection via workshops and structured product research\n- 2025 Input Output Engineering Core Development Proposal\n- UTxO RPC: Sustaining Cardano Blockchain Integration\n- Dolos: Sustaining a Lightweight Cardano Data Node\n- Pallas: Sustaining Critical Rust Tooling for Cardano\n- MLabs Core Tool Maintenance & Enhancement: Ply\n- MLabs Core Tool Maintenance & Enhancement: CLB\n- MLabs Maintenance & Enhancement: Atlas PAB\n- MLabs Core Tool Maintenance & Enhancement: Cardano Transaction Library (CTL)\n- MLabs Core Tool Maintenance & Enhancement: Plutarch\n- Extended Symbolic\n- Lucid Evolution Maintenance\n- OSC Budget Proposal - Paid Open Source Model for Sustainable Development\n- zkFold ZK Rollup\n- Atlas PAB: Hydra and L2 Integration (Midgard, Midnight, ZkFold)\n- Blockfrost Platform Community Budget Proposal\n- Extended UPLC Converter\n- Complete Web3 developer stack to make Cardano the smart contract layer for Bitcoin\n- Midgard - Optimistic Rollups\n- Gerolamo - cardano node in typescript\n- Atlas PAB - Chainlink Oracle Integration\n- ZK Bridge\n- Atlas PAB: Aiken and Governance Integration\n - Atlas PAB: Hydra and L2 Integration (Midgard, Midnight, ZkFold)\n- AdaStat..net Cardano blockchain explorer\n- Quality Assurance: On-Chain & Off-Chain Audit\n- ADAspending,com - Cardano Treasury Explorer - An open data source for tracking treasury spending on the Cardano blockchain\n- DRep Incentivization Framework\n- SyncGovHub: An intelligent Transparent, and Action-Oriented Platform for Cardano Governance\n- Cardano Constitutional Committee Formation and - Governance Training with the SanchoNet Education Network\n- Cardano Governance MCP: natural language access to governance data\n- The Cardano community's open-source tool for participation in its governance: Cardano Govtool\n- Membership & Community Committee (MCC) - Global Community Hubs Expansion Program\n- Cardano Summit 2025 and regional tech events\n- Cardano Builder DAO\n- Marketing Infrastructure for Cardano\n- Amplify Cardano: Community-Led Events Fund by Rare Network\n- Amplify Cardano: Community-Led Marketing Fund by - Rare Network\n- Business Lead Generation on Cardano\n- Cardano Ecosystem Pavilions at Exhibitions\n- A.L.B.A. Network\n- Cardano Curation Short-Form Video Marketing Initiative\n- Catalyst 2025 Proposal by Input Output: Advancing Decentralised Community Innovation Funding & Infrastructure\n- Growth & Marketing Committee (GMC) Budget Proposal"

          "originalText": "✅ I voted YES for the Amaru project. \n\nMy Rationale\n\nNode diversity is critical for decentralization and network resilience. When multiple independent teams build node software, it reduces reliance on a single entity, such as IOG in the case of Cardano. \n\nIt minimizes the systemic risks associated with monoculture software development.\n\nOne of the core promises of blockchain networks is high availability, including strong resistance to attacks and censorship. \n\nWhile no system can guarantee 100% uptime, having multiple node implementations increases the network’s robustness. If a bug or vulnerability is present in one version, others may remain unaffected, limiting potential damage.\n\nEncouraging additional node implementations also deepens understanding of the protocol. As more developers build and maintain nodes, they contribute to refining the protocol specification, surfacing ambiguities, and improving long-term maintainability. \n\nThis also supports future clients by setting a clearer and more battle-tested standard.\n\nFor comparison, Bitcoin is largely dependent on a single implementation: Bitcoin Core. While there are alternatives (e.g., btcd, Bitcoin Knots), they are rarely used, making the network heavily reliant on a single development team. \n\nThis centralization becomes especially visible during governance disputes, such as those surrounding the use of the OP_RETURN opcode and Ordinals.\n\nIn contrast, Ethereum has multiple actively maintained implementations for both its consensus and execution layers. These include clients like Geth, Nethermind, Besu, Erigon (execution), and Prysm, Lighthouse, Teku, Nimbus (consensus). \n\nThis diversity has strengthened Ethereum's decentralization and made the network more resilient to bugs and performance issues in any single client.\n\nNode diversity, however, comes with challenges. \n\nDivergent implementations can lead to consensus bugs or temporary chain splits if not carefully tested. \n\nCoordinated testnets and protocol-level specification clarity are essential to mitigate these risks. \n\nProtocol upgrades may also take longer, as all implementations must integrate and validate changes, such as the upcoming Ouroboros Leios, which both IOG and Amaru nodes will need to support.\n\nSustained funding is another consideration. \n\nMaintaining multiple full node implementations is resource-intensive and will likely require long-term support from the Cardano Treasury. \n\nHowever, the cost is justified by the increased decentralization, security, and community participation that such diversity brings.\n\nThe Amaru team's funding request is reasonable, especially compared to the budgets that IOG requires. \n\nThe team includes respected developers from within the Cardano ecosystem and is supported by several reputable entities. Their proposed Rust-based node implementation would be a serious alternative to IOG’s Haskell-based Cardano node, marking a crucial step forward for ecosystem resilience.\n\nThis initiative strengthens decentralization, improves protocol robustness, and represents a healthy evolution of the Cardano network.\n\nMy DRep ID:\ndrep1km69g7ksf8t5g0h9d9tkrcd2tezxelx0wtr76rv2mrkl5nzd6v3"

          "text": "隨著 Cardano 2025年預算流程的推進，出現了多個重新評估淨變更限額 (NCL) 的提案。以下是當前情況的概要：\n\n✅ 已核准：DReps 已正式核准2025年3.5億 ADA 的 NCL。它基於2024年的財政收入模型（約3.36億 ADA），現在是當前預算審議的基礎。\n\n❌ 已拒絕：一項更保守的提案，建議將2025年上限設為3億 ADA，2026年上限設為2.5億 ADA，未獲核准。\n\n🟠 審查中：\n「2025 Cardano NCL」提議將 NCL 降至2億 ADA，敦促在去中心化財政治理的第一年採取謹慎態度。\n「Epochs 563–635 的3億 ADA」旨在為2026年初設立 NCL，支持重疊時期的預算連續性。\n\n與此同時，已提交了若干新的資金提案：\n\n1⃣ 750萬 ADA 用於社群建設者提案 — 僅包括那些獲得≥26.9億 ADA 支持的提案，不包括 Intersect 和創始實體的提案。\n\n2⃣ 150萬 ADA 用於 Amaru Rust 節點開發 — 一項由 PRAGMA 主導的旨在實現 Cardano 節點多樣化並增強網路彈性的倡議。\n\n3⃣ 5000萬 ADA 用於 DeFi 流動性 — 旨在向 DEX 和穩定幣注入流動性，部分收益將返還給財政庫。\n\n作為 SIPO DRep，我們正在根據以下幾點評估這些進展：\n\n🔍 謹慎治理：支持2億 ADA 的 NCL。\n🚀 成長與勢頭：支持維持3.5億 ADA 的上限。\n⚖️ 平衡妥協：3億 ADA 可能是一個務實的中間立場。\n\n對於資金提案，我們的評估將側重於：\n它是否能為財政庫帶來回報？\n是否確保了透明度和執行能力？\n它是否為去中心化金融治理的第一年樹立了強而有力的先例？\n\nNCL 不僅僅是一個數字 — 它反映了 Cardano 的金融理念和成長軌跡。改變上限直接影響哪些提案是可行的。\n\n我們很快將公佈 SIPO 對每個主要提案的評估標準和投票邏輯。在此期間，我們歡迎您在投票開始前提出意見。\n\n如果您支持我們作為 DRep 的工作，請考慮委託：\n\nDRep ID：\ndrep1yffld2866p00cyg3ejjdewtvazgah7jjgk0s9m7m5ytmmdq33v3zh\n\n對於 Daedalus：\ndrep120m237kstm7pzywv5nwtjm8gj8dl55j9nupwlkapz77mgv7zu7l",

          "originalText": "As Cardano’s 2025 budget process gains momentum, multiple proposals have emerged to reassess the Net Change Limit (NCL). Here’s a breakdown of the current situation:\n\n✅ Approved: The 2025 NCL of 350M ADA has been formally ratified by DReps. It’s based on a 2024 treasury income model (approx. 336M ADA) and now serves as the foundation for current budget deliberations.\n\n❌ Rejected: A more conservative proposal to cap 2025 at 300M ADA and 2026 at 250M ADA was not approved.\n\n🟠 Under Review:\n“2025 Cardano NCL” proposes lowering the NCL to 200M ADA, urging a cautious approach during this first year of decentralized treasury governance.\n“300M ADA for Epochs 563–635” aims to establish an NCL for early 2026, supporting budget continuity across overlapping periods.\n\nMeanwhile, several new funding proposals have been submitted:\n\n1⃣ 7.5M ADA for Community Builder Proposals — includes only those with ≥2.69B ADA support, excluding proposals from Intersect and founding entities.\n\n2⃣ 1.5M ADA for Amaru Rust Node Development — a PRAGMA-led initiative to diversify Cardano nodes and enhance network resilience.\n\n3⃣ 50M ADA for DeFi Liquidity — aims to seed liquidity into DEXs and stablecoins, with yield partially returned to the treasury.\n\nAs SIPO DRep, we’re evaluating these developments based on:\n\n🔍 Cautious governance: supports the 200M ADA NCL.\n🚀 Growth & momentum: supports maintaining the 350M ADA cap.\n⚖️ Balanced compromise: 300M ADA could be a pragmatic middle ground.\n\nFor funding proposals, our assessment will focus on:\nDoes it generate a return to the treasury?\nIs transparency and execution capacity ensured?\nDoes it set a strong precedent for the first year of decentralized financial governance?\n\nThe NCL is more than just a number — it reflects Cardano’s financial philosophy and growth trajectory. Changing the cap directly impacts which proposals are viable.\n\nWe’ll soon publish SIPO’s evaluation criteria and vote logic for each major proposal. In the meantime, we welcome your input before the voting begins.\n\nIf you support our work as a DRep, please consider delegating:\n\nDRep ID:\ndrep1yffld2866p00cyg3ejjdewtvazgah7jjgk0s9m7m5ytmmdq33v3zh\n\nFor Daedalus:\ndrep120m237kstm7pzywv5nwtjm8gj8dl55j9nupwlkapz77mgv7zu7l"

          "text": "作為 #Cardano 生態系統中的一名 DRep，我剛剛對 @Amaru_Cardano 提案投了贊成票！\n我相信 Amaru 是我們迄今為止看到的最好的行動之一，因為它獨立於 Intersect 運作，並且符合憲法路徑。💪\nAmaru 帶來了節點多樣性、效率和增強的互通性，同時優先考慮去中心化和高保證。\n\n我的理由：\n1. 節點多樣性和去中心化：Amaru 計畫透過引入一個新的用 Rust 編寫的出塊節點，解決了 Cardano 網路中的一個關鍵需求。這透過減少對單一 Haskell 實作的依賴來提高彈性，從而增強網路的容錯能力和去中心化。\n\n2. 效能和效率：Amaru 優先考慮更好的資源利用，包括更低的記憶體消耗和透過產業標準監控增強的可觀察性。這一改進透過降低硬體要求使權益池營運商 (SPOs) 受益，最終降低營運成本。\n\n3. 增強的互通性：基於 Rust 的方法不僅吸引了更廣泛的開發人員群體，而且還與現有的區塊鏈解決方案無縫整合。這種模組化和靈活的設計擴展了 Cardano 生態系統未來創新和用例的潛力。\n\n4. 高保證和穩健性：Amaru 的開發過程包括徹底的一致性測試和識別現有實作中的不一致之處。這種細緻的方法有助於網路的整體安全性和穩定性。\n\n5. 負責任的預算和治理：該提案透過明確的全職員工 (FTE) 需求明細和應急計畫，展示了財務責任。此外，使用鏈上智能合約進行預算管理可確保透明度和問責制。\n\n6. 社群驅動和開源：Amaru 的開源模型由 PRAGMA（一個信譽良好的多實體協作組織）管理，確保了社群參與和長期維護。定期的更新和演示可以促進透明度並維持社群信任。\n\n查看我的投票交易：https://t.co/xFStBmUKjs",

          "originalText": "As a DRep in the #Cardano ecosystem, I just voted YES on the @Amaru_Cardano proposal! \n I believe Amaru is one of the best actions we've seen so far because it operates independently from Intersect and aligns with the constitutional path. 💪\n Amaru brings node diversity, efficiency, and enhanced interoperability. all while prioritizing decentralization and high assurance.\n\nMy rationale:\n1. Node Diversity and Decentralization: The Amaru project addresses a critical need in the Cardano network by introducing a new block-producing node written in Rust. This increases resilience by reducing dependency on a single Haskell implementation, thereby enhancing the network's fault tolerance and decentralization.\n\n2. Performance and Efficiency: Amaru prioritizes better resource usage, including lower memory consumption and enhanced observability through industry-standard monitoring. This improvement benefits Stake Pool Operators (SPOs) by lowering hardware requirements, ultimately reducing operational costs.\n\n3. Enhanced Interoperability: The Rust-based approach not only attracts a wider pool of developers but also integrates seamlessly with existing blockchain solutions. This modular and flexible design expands the potential for future innovations and use cases within the Cardano ecosystem.\n\n4. High Assurance and Robustness: The development process of Amaru includes thorough conformance testing and the identification of inconsistencies in existing implementations. This meticulous approach contributes to the network's overall security and stability.\n\n5. Responsible Budget and Governance: The proposal demonstrates financial responsibility with a clear breakdown of Full-Time Employee (FTE) requirements and contingency planning. Moreover, the use of an on-chain smart contract for budget administration ensures transparency and accountability.\n\n6. Community-Driven and Open-Source: Amaru's open-source model, managed by PRAGMA—a reputable multi-entity effort—ensures community engagement and long-term maintenance. Regular updates and demos foster transparency and maintain community trust.\n\n Check out my voting transaction: https://t.co/xFStBmUKjs"

The maximum amount that can be withdrawn from the treasury during the specified period shall not exceed the total sum outlined herein.\n\nThe provisions set forth in the Cardano Constitution state that the approval of a NCL requires a threshold of greater than 50% of the active voting DRep stake. Therefore, this NCL will be considered passed if it is greater than 50+1 lovelace%.\n\nIn the event of conflict, this NCL supersedes any prior NCL covering all or part of calendar year 2025.",

        "summary": "該提案建議為 Cardano 財政庫設定2億 ada 的淨變化限額 (NCL)，適用於2025年剩餘的大約八個月，具體從 Epoch 532 開始至 Epoch 604 結束 。此舉被定位為全面鏈上財政治理的一個謹慎的初步步驟。其預期目標是允許財政庫積累資源，同時 Cardano 社群發展和完善其預算、資金分配和審計流程 。提案者承認2024年財政庫流入可能約為3.5億 ada，但主張初期採用較低的 NCL，以減輕因社群在管理核心開發者支付和大規模生態系統資金方面經驗相對不足而帶來的風險 。計畫是從這一初期階段吸取經驗，以便為2026年設定一個更有經驗依據的 NCL 。這種保守的財政方法是在 Cardano 更廣泛的戰略背景下提出的，該背景強調其技術基礎設施（如 Leios 升級、Hydra 協議和 Layer 2 擴展解決方案）需要重大發展，促進生態系統發展以保持與其他領先區塊鏈平台的競爭力，並在 Voltaire 時代下使其去中心化治理模式成熟化 。",
        "myOpinion": "為2025年剩餘時間設定2億 ada NCL 的提案反映了在 Cardano 向更去中心化、鏈上財政治理過渡過程中值得稱讚的謹慎願望 。然而，對照 Cardano 的首要戰略目標——持續發展其技術基礎設施，包括 Leios 升級、Hydra 協議和 Layer 2 擴展解決方案等關鍵舉措 ——以及「為優秀工程支付溢價」的明確目標 ，此 NCL 顯得可能過於嚴格。社群回饋經常強調，核心開發（例如 IOG）的資金需求本身就可能消耗此2億 ada 限額的很大一部分，甚至大部分 。這將使得用於其他重要技術進步（來自不同生態系統貢獻者）、更廣泛的 L2 擴展工作、DeFi 增長和新項目孵化的資源所剩無几——而所有這些對於 Cardano 的長期成功和競爭力都至關重要 。雖然審慎是必要的 ，但戰略技術重點投入不足可能會比初期採用一個略高但仍謹慎管理的 NCL 所帶來的風險更大程度地阻礙 Cardano 的發展軌跡。實施2億 NCL 的後果可能包括技術進展減緩 Helix 和生態系統受限 ，並可能需要被動的治理行動來向上調整限額 。不實施（或沒有 NCL）將中止符合憲法的財政庫提款 。考慮到這些因素，我**反對**在2025年指定的約8個月期限內採用2億 ada NCL 的提案，因為它可能無法充分服務於 Cardano 的戰略技術要務。一個略高但仍屬謹慎的 NCL（例如，此部分年度的2.5億至2.75億 ada 範圍）可能會提供一個更平衡的方案：既強調財政謹慎，允許治理流程成熟 ，又為 Cardano 實現其成為領先區塊鏈平台的長期願景所必需的關鍵技術發展和生態系統建設提供更現實的支持 。這應與快速成熟的透明預算、基於里程碑的資金和審計流程相結合 。"

          "text": "🔥 #Cardano 治理更新 🔥\n\nCardano 的未來岌岌可危：更新、憲法、財政庫和預算。\n\nPlomin 硬分叉\n\n此更新將是全面參與 Cardano 治理的最後一步，該治理由 CIP-1694 設計。預計 Plomin 硬分叉很快就會在鏈上提交。幾個月前，當 Chang 硬分叉實施時，它啟動了治理引導階段，允許授權代表 (DReps) 在鏈上註冊，並成立了憲法委員會 (CC) 與權益池運營商 (SPOs) 一起對治理行動 (GAs) 進行投票。然而，治理是有限的。\n\n一旦 Plomin 硬分叉通過，DReps 將獲得完整的投票權，而不僅僅是對資訊行動的投票權（請訪問 https://t.co/aRWErA7Waj 查看不同類型治理行動的指南）。這意味著 Cardano 社群將能夠更新 Cardano 憲法並從 Cardano 財政庫中提取資金。\n\n我們為什麼關心制定憲法和從財政庫提取資金？坦率地說，這是因為 Cardano 已經成長起來，我們現在必須開始獨立生活。當 Cardano 於 2017 年啟動時，先驅實體獲得了 Ada 的資助（約佔總供應量的 20%），以便為我們提供一個我們使用者可以自我治理的去中心化生態系統。現在我們擁有了治理權，我們需要堅定地制定基本規則，以保護 Cardano 生態系統中每個互動者的權利，我們需要共同決定 Cardano 未來的發展路線圖，並且我們需要有辦法為此付費！\n\n憲法\n\n過去幾個月對 Cardano 來說是歷史性的時刻，社群參與了起草新憲法的審議過程。雖然 Chang 硬分叉建立了一部臨時憲法，但該文件是在有計畫替換的情況下編寫的。@IntersectMBO 在 @InputOutputHK、@Cardano_CF、@emurgo_io 和無數社群貢獻者的幫助下，在全球舉辦了 63 場研討會，從中選出了制憲會議的代表。這些代表參加了綜合會議，審查了由 Intersect 的 Cardano 公民委員會起草的新憲法提案的語言，徵求了社群對擬議修改的意見回饋，然後齊聚布宜諾斯艾利斯和奈洛比進行辯論並批准了最終草案。\n\n儘管如此，這部新憲法尚未獲得批准！在像 Cardano 這樣的區塊鏈技術去中心化生態系統中，新憲法的建立必須得到 Ada 持有者（由其 DReps 代表）投票贊成後才能生效。一旦 Plomin 硬分叉通過（祈禱！），社群將能夠考慮採取治理行動来批准新憲法。如果必須，我們可以繼續在臨時憲法下運作，但盡快轉向一部源於社群審查程序的新憲法將是更可取的。\n\n財政庫\n\nCardano 最獨特和最強大的方面之一是我們擁有一個共同的財政庫，用於支持區塊鏈生態系統的營運、維護和未來發展。每個 Epoch，獎勵池的 20%（交易費和貨幣擴張）會進入財政庫，其餘部分則用於權益獎勵。\n\n由於該財政庫的資金來源於本應屬於 Cardano 社群成員的權益獎勵，因此必須對其進行保護。這就是為什麼臨時憲法和擬議憲法都規定，在進行任何財政庫提款之前，必須通過治理資訊行動批准淨變化限額。\n\n社群採用的淨變化限額必須規定在特定時間內可以從財政庫中支出多少 Ada。出於實際目的（至少在我們開始時），這很可能意味著我們決定在 73 個 epoch（一個日曆年）內支出多少。由於 CC 有義務否決任何不符合既定淨變化限額的財政庫提款 GA，因此我們必須確保該值符合我們當年的計畫支出，並考慮到可能出現的意外情況。這需要巧妙的平衡！\n\n預算\n\n除了淨變化限額之外，臨時憲法和擬議憲法還規定，任何財政庫提款 GA 都必須符合 Cardano 社群通過 DReps 投票批准的預算，否則無法通過。CC 還必須對任何擬議預算進行投票，以確保擬議支出不違反憲法。\n\n憲法文本中的預算要求特意保持靈活性，以便為 Cardano 社群提供資助去中心化生態系統的多種選擇。臨時憲法僅規定必須有某個預算存在，而擬議憲法則更明確地描述了每個預算必須有一名管理人，以確保財政庫提款得到妥善使用。該管理人可以是個人、機構或智能合約，我預計這種做法會隨著時間的推移而發展。\n\n雖然 Cardano 上的任何人都可以提出預算，但大量的社群努力一直集中在與 @IntersectMBO 合作，提出一項支持 Cardano 2025 年的全面預算。這一過程已接近完成，預算委員會表示他們很快就會向社群報告其提案。他們已經舉行了多次社群會議，描述了這一過程并徵求了意見回饋。\n\nIntersect 方法的關鍵之一是確保沒有單一個人負責資金管理。Intersect 將提出的預算會將管理人職責分配給由 Cardano 社群成員營運的 Intersect 各個委員會。再次強調，我們正在尋求在去中心化的好處與賦權於民以實現更大利益是推動進程的最佳方式這一認知之間取得平衡。\n\n時間表與結論\n\n既然我們已經清楚 Cardano 未來需要發生什麼，我們就可以討論每項行動的時間安排。每次提出治理行動時，Cardano 社群都有 6 個 Epoch（30 天）的時間進行投票，然後 GA 需要一個 Epoch 才能生效。雖然大多數行動可以提前通過（如果它們獲得了必要的贊成票門檻），但最好保守估計投票將持續整個可能的時間長度。\n\n如果 Plomin 硬分叉 GA 於 12 月 21 日（Cardano Epoch 529 開始之日）提交，我們預計它可能會在 1 月 24 日（Epoch 536）生效。屆時，也只有到那時，我們才能合理地提交憲法以供批准。財政庫也將解鎖，DReps 可以考慮財政庫提款治理行動。\n\n雖然財政庫將於 1 月 24 日解鎖（前提是 Plomin 硬分叉 GA 通過），但在淨變化限額和至少一項預算獲得批准之前，CC 不會批准 DReps 提取資金的任何行動。這意味著我們需要讓 DReps 和 CC 對治理資訊行動进行投票以批准这些项目，然后才能提交任何财库提款。\n\n幸運的是，由於 DReps 目前能夠對資訊行動進行投票，我們無需等待 Plomin 硬分叉生效即可開始這些討論。社群可以在同一時間窗口內考慮并對硬分叉、淨變化限額和擬議預算進行投票。我們有很多重要問題需要解決，但我相信我們能夠克服它們，并展示去中心化治理如何使一個排名前十的區塊鏈生態系統不僅能夠運作，而且能夠蓬勃發展！\n\n如果你和我一樣是區塊鏈治理的愛好者，那麼你讀到這裡可能一直在點頭，並且一直參與其中。如果你剛剛接觸這個領域並且讀到了這裡，我希望你能加入我們，共同邁出旅程的下一步。無論如何，假期好好休息一下，因為一月份對於 Cardano 來說將是一個激動人心的時刻！",

          "originalText": "🔥 #Cardano Governance Update 🔥\n\nWhat's at stake for the future of Cardano: The Update, The Constitution, the Treasury, and the Budgets.\n\nThe Plomin Hard Fork \n\nThis update will be the final step to full participation in Cardano Governance as designed by CIP-1694. Expect to see the Plomin Hard Fork submitted on chain very soon.  A few months ago, when the Chang Hard Fork was enacted, it activated the Governance Bootstrap Phase which allowed Delegated Representatives (DReps) to register on-chain and established the Constitutional Committee (CC) to vote on Governance Actions (GAs) along with Stake Pool Operators (SPOs).  However, governance was limited.\n\nOnce the Plomin Hard Fork passes the DReps will gain full voting power, not just the ability to vote on Info Actions (visit https://t.co/aRWErA7Waj for a guide to the different type of Governance Actions).  This means that the Cardano Community will be able to update the Cardano Constitution and withdraw funds from the Cardano Treasury.\n\nWhy do we care about establishing the Constitution and withdrawing funds from the Treasury?  Well, quite frankly, it's because Cardano has grown up and we have to start living on our own now.  When Cardano was launched in 2017 the pioneering entities were given grants of Ada (about 20% of the total supply) in order to deliver us a decentralized ecosystem that the we, the users, could govern ourselves.  Now that we have the power of governance we need to firmly set the ground rules that protects the rights of everyone who interacts in the Cardano ecosystem, we need to collectively decide on the future development roadmap of Cardano, and we need to have a way to pay for it!\n\nThe Constitution\n\nThe past few months have been a historic time for Cardano as the community engaged in a deliberative process to draft a new Constitution.  While an Interim Constitution had been established with the Chang Hard Fork that document was written with an intentional plan for replacement.  @IntersectMBO with the help of @InputOutputHK, @Cardano_CF, @emurgo_io, and countless community contributors held 63 workshops across the world where Delegates for a Constitutional Convention were selected. These Delegates participated in synthesis sessions to review the language of the proposed new constitution that had been drafted by the Cardano Civics Committee of Intersect, solicited community feedback on proposed changes, and then came together in Buenos Aires and Nairobi to debate and approve a final draft.\n\nAll that being said, this new Constitution is not yet approved!  In a decentralized ecosystem of blockchain technology like Cardano, the establishment of a new Constitution cannot be valid until the Ada holders, as represented by their DReps, vote in favor.  Once the Plomin Hard Fork has passed (fingers crossed!) the community will be able to consider a Governance Action to ratify the new Constitution.  We can continue to operate under the Interim Constitution, if we must, but it would be far preferable to move to a new Constitution that came from a community review process as soon as possible.\n\nThe Treasury\n\nOne of the most unique and powerful aspects of Cardano is that we have a common Treasury to provide for the operation, maintenance, and future development of the blockchain ecosystem. Each Epoch, 20% of the Rewards Pool (transaction fees and monetary expansion) goes to the Treasury instead while the rest goes to Staking Rewards.\n\nBecause this Treasury comes out of the Staking Rewards that would otherwise go to the members of the Cardano Community, it is essential that the fund be safeguarded.  That is why the Interim Constitution and the proposed Constitution both specify that a Net Change Limit must be approved through a Governance Info Action before any Treasury Withdrawals are made.\n\nThe Net Change Limit that is adopted by the community must define how much Ada can be spent out of the Treasury in a certain amount of time.  For practical purposes (at least as we start), this will most likely mean that we decide how much to spend in 73 epochs (a calendar year).  Because the CC is obligated to vote down any Treasury Withdrawal GA that does not fit within the established Net Change Limit, we must make sure that this value fits within our planned spending for the year and allows for contingencies that may come up.  There is a fine balance to be struck!\n\nThe Budgets\n\nIn addition to the Net Change Limit, the Interim Constitution and the proposed Constitution specify that the no Treasury Withdrawal GA can pass unless it fits within a Budget that has been approved by the Cardano community through a vote by DReps.  The CC must also vote on any proposed budget to ensure that proposed spending does not violate the Constitution.\n\nWith text of the Constitution, the Budget requirements are purposefully flexible to give the Cardano Community options to fund the decentralized ecosystem.  While the Interim Constitution simply says there must be some Budget in place, the proposed Constitution is a bit more explicit in describing how each Budget must have an Administrator to ensure Treasury Withdrawals are properly spent.  This Administrator could be a person, an institution, or a smart contract, and I expect we will see this practice evolve over time.\n\nWhile anyone on Cardano can propose a budget, a large amount of community effort has been focused on working with @IntersectMBO to propose a comprehensive budget to support Cardano in 2025.  This process is nearing completion and the Budget Committee has stated they will be ready to report their proposal to the community soon.  They have already held numerous community meetings describing the process and soliciting feedback.\n\nOne of the keys to Intersect's approach will be to ensure that there is no single person in charge of the administration of funds.  The Budgets that Intersect will propose will give Administrator responsibilities to various committees of Intersect that are run by Cardano community members.  Again, we are seeking to balance the benefits of decentralization with the recognition that empowering people to act for the greater good is the best way to move a process forward.\n\nThe Timeline & Conclusion\n\nNow that we have a clear picture on what needs to happen for Cardano to move forward, we can discuss the timing of each action. Each time a Governance Action is proposed the Cardano community has 6 Epochs (30 days) to vote on it and then it takes one Epoch for the GA to take effect.  While most actions can pass early (if they get the necessary threshold of Yes votes) it is best to make a conservative estimate that the vote will run the full length of time possible.\n\nIf the Plomin Hard Fork GA is submitted on December 21 (the beginning of Cardano Epoch 529) we are looking at probable enactment on January 24 (Epoch 536).  Then, and only then, can we reasonably submit the Constitution for ratification.  The Treasury will also be unlocked and DReps can consider Treasury Withdrawal Governance Actions.\n\nWhile the Treasury will be unlocked on January 24, provided that the Plomin Hard Fork GA passes, the CC will not approve any actions the DReps take to withdraw funds unless the Net Change Limit and at least one Budget have been approved.  That means that we will need to have the DReps and CC vote on Governance Info Actions to approve these items before any Treasury Withdrawals are submitted.\n\nFortunately, because DReps are able to vote for Info Actions right now, we do not need to wait for the Plomin Hard Fork to be enacted to begin these discussions.  The community can consider and vote on the Hard Fork, the Net Change Limit, and the proposed Budgets within the same window of time.  We have a lot of important issues to figure out but I am confident that we can work through them and show how decentralized governance can make a Top-10 Blockchain ecosystem not just function but thrive!\n\nIf you're a Blockchain Governance nerd like me, you've probably been nodding along as you read this and have been along for the ride up to this point.  If you're just getting into it and have read this far, I hope you'll join us for the next big step of the journey.  Either way, get some rest over the holidays, because January is going to be an exciting time for Cardano!"

          "originalText": "I announce that I intend to vote NO ❌on the governance action regarding the Net Change Limit for 2025 and 2026 in a few days.\n\n🚨Please redelegate to another Cardano DRep if you wish that your stake counts towards a YES or ABSTAIN vote. 🚨\n\n- I have read the governance info action and I welcome its submission and the reasonable proposal that was put forward.\n- I was originally inclined to vote YES, as we could face a period of analysis paralysis and the proposal seemed reasonable enough.\n- I continued to follow the debate about the proposed governance info action \"Set 2025 Net Change Limit of 300M ADA, 2026 Net Change Limit of 250M ADA\".\n- However, Cardano constitution does not explicitly define what is a Net Change Limit (NCL). Different participants have shown that they may have different understandings of the meaning. Some do not understand it. Does NCL include inflows and/or outflows into the treasury? How is NCL calculated exactly? The precise definition is unclear. Voting YES until this is cleared up in the constitution could result in poorly understood actions leading to unexpected consequences. This could jeopardize the stability of the Cardano monetary system. Of course, this not the fault of the proposers of this governance action. Their governance action helped to uncover this lack of precision in the Cardano constitution.\n- The proposed governance action proposes setting the NCL close to the maximum projected inflows into the treasury. The maximum inflows are forecast to be 300M ADA in 2025 and 265M ADA in 2026. On the face of it, it is a relatively reasonable proposal to set the NCL to 300M ADA in 2025 and to 250M ADA in 2026.\n- I do not think there is a need to set the NCL for 2026 at this moment in time. Although I welcome the idea of making it no higher than the inflows.\n- Through this vote rationale I am also signaling that even if I do vote for a motion that sets the NCL to 300M ADA in 2025 and 250M ADA in 2026, it is not likely that I will vote for a Cardano annual budget and withdrawals that are as high as 300M ADA in 2025.\n- Hence, I would prefer to see a proposal of a smaller NCL for 2025, probably 200-250M ADA. This will help focus the budgetary discussion on essentials.\n- I also have to consider that Catalyst has been allocated 150M ADA for three funds in 2024. Not all of this has been disbursed as the Catalyst payments are milestone based and some Catalyst projects give up or just stall. Many payments still take place in 2025. The proposed NCL for 2025 of 300M ADA is twice the size of what was allocated to Catalyst in 2024.\n- I also agree with suggestions that I think the Net Change Limit (NCL) could be linked to or calculated based on net treasury revenue for the previous 73 epochs.  This was proposed by Cardano DRep CardanoYoda: \"If the NCL is set to, for example, 80% and Treasury revenue for the last year was 300M ADA, 240M ADA could be spent.\" The advantages of this solution are that it is not necessary to project future Treasury revenue. A similar idea was floated by Cardano community member Max Capacity in the TECH SPO Discord: \" Monte Carlo simulations for estimating forward value? There's just so much variability and it opens it up to second guessing and even more wasted time and energy. Just use the prior year and no one can argue anything and you have certainty on Dec 31 reach year. I also like the last 73 epoch idea because it then means you don't have to stick to the calendar periodicity. Maybe the budget runs June to July. \""

A lot can happen between now and 2026, setting a 2026 limit seems premature - hence a bad precedent. \nI welcome the attempt by the proposers to highlight a need for conservative spending, by roughly limiting the NCL to the volume of of Cardano annual treasury inflows in 2025 and 2026."

          "originalText": "Let me explain the Net Change Limit in context.\n\nThe Net Change Limit (NCL) serves as a prevention against excessive withdrawal of ADA from the Treasury.\n\nThe NCL defines the maximum amount of ADA that can be withdrawn from the Treasury in a given period. This period is usually one year, which corresponds to 72 epochs.\n\nThe NCL can be defined as the amount of ADA for a given period. An alternative approach would be to express it as a percentage of Treasury revenue for a given past period.\n\nFor example, as 80% of Treasury revenue for the last 72 epochs.\n\nIt is up to the community to choose what they like best. \n\nThe first approach is more flexible because it is necessary to approve the NCL every year. The second approach could work in the long term without annual approval.\n\nThe NCL must be approved through governance action before it is possible to submit a proposal for withdrawal of ADA from the Treasury.\n\nThe NCL applies to all withdrawals from the Treasury in a given period.\n\nOnce the total number of ADA individually withdrawn from the Treasury reaches the defined NCL, further withdrawals exceeding the limit will become unconstitutional.\n\nThere is currently no NCL defined, so withdrawals are not possible.\n\nThere are two governance actions regarding NCL for next year.\n\nThe first one submitted by the community tries to set the NCL at 300M ADA. The second one from intersect sets 350M ADA.\n\nThere are currently 1.71B ADA in the Cardano Treasury.\n\nRevenues to the treasury consist of monetary expansion and fees. Fees are currently almost negligible. \n\nMost of the revenues consist of monetary expansion, i.e. the gradual transfer of ADA from the reserve to the Treasury.\n\nThere are currently 7.2B ADA in the reserve. The reserve is used to pay out staking rewards and deposit ADA into the Treasury.\n\nThe reserve is gradually trending towards 0. With each subsequent epoch, the reserve is decreasing. \n\nTreasury revenues will depend on fees and possibly other alternative revenues in the future.\n\nNCL is to prevent the rapid depletion of the Treasury, as ADA should be used to grow the ecosystem. \n\nBy this you can imagine a payment to IOG for the delivery of Ouroboros Leios, but also, for example, minting stablecoins. Basically, anything that the community approves.\n\nThere is a consensus that expenses should not be higher than Treasury revenues. NCL should reflect this. However, it is theoretically possible to approve NCL higher than Treasury revenues.\n\nAn important aspect of NCL is the direct negative impact on the market price of ADA. Entities that receive ADA from the Treasury can sell coins on the market to cover their living expenses.\n\nSelling pressure can harm SPOs and stakers.\n\nUltimately, this can also have a negative impact on Treasury, because if the market price of ADA is low in a bear market, it will be necessary to sell even more ADA in the coming years.\n\nIt is necessary to find a balance between the potential long-term positive impact of the investment and the medium-term market price of ADA.\n\nNCL does not mean that we have to spend a defined maximum. It is possible to approve an NCL of 350M ADA, but still, only 200M ADA can be approved in total spending in a given period.\n\nNCL is only an insurance against exceeding the limit. \n\nMore important are individual withdrawals. Each of them must be justified and we must be sure that the investment will have a positive impact on the ecosystem from the long-term perspective."

The proposers have stated that from January 5th, 2024, Epoch 459, through December 30th, Epoch 531, the actual total income into the Cardano Treasury was 335,957,093 ada.\n\nThe proposed NCL is 350M ada. This is roughly 14M ada higher than the total income in the Cardano Treasury for 2024. I welcome the proposed reference to modelling and the reference to a previous period for which we have data. \n\nThe motion uses modelling of ADA inflow for the previous year as the main basis for approving an NCL. It is indeed one of the factors that must be considered.\n \nWhat I am missing in this proposal - as it proposes a relatively large NCL - is even a minor economic analysis of how approvals of different NCLs could impact the valuation of ADA. An NCL of 350M ADA is sending a signal to the market. What is this signal? \n\nHow does it compare to previous signals? If we do not have the data, is there room for a prediction at least?\nWith the lack of this economic/monetary analysis, we are left to speculate. My feeling is that NCL approvals in the future will become defining moments that shape the ADA exchange rate vs the USD. It is a signal how much ADA could be released - a signal approved by the majority of DReps. \n\nThe approval of a large NCL could have an immediate price impact on the value of ADA, thus diminishing the purchase power of the 350M ADA. Before the budget elements are approved. \n\nAfter approving a large NCL, the budgetary discussions will probably take place in the shadow of a lower ADA/USD exchange rate. Thus we might be forced by the market to push an annual budget towards the top limit of the NCL. We could create a self-fulfilling prophesy. \n\nThe problem I see with a very large first year NCL is that our budgetary and governance processes are the weakest and most inefficient in the first year. Our ability to audit, prevent waste and abuse are questionable. A lower NCL would focus minds.\n\nWithout a monetary/economic analysis or forecast, I would consider voting for a NCL in the 200-250M ADA in 2025 (depending on the text of the NCL proposal) as it would give a better signal to the market about our intentions to balance the development of the system and the intention to safeguard the value of ADA and Cardano's Top 10 position. Especially, as our abilities to manage the potential spending of so much ADA in the early days of decentralized governance are the lowest. \n\nI see this conservative approach as something that protects the interests of ADA holders and stakers. \n\nBest practice: We SHOULD approve the closest NCL to the actual budget that we want as DReps. By approving a much larger NCL we will be devaluing the ada currency BEFORE any budget is approved and before the contractors receive the ADA. Effectively crippling ourselves unnecessarily. \n\nIf the intention is to approve a lower budget than 350M ada as some (many?) DReps seem to have indicated, then to preserve the value of that ada for those who will receive it, the best thing we can do is to vote for an NCL that is closest to that intended 2025 budget total."

Your biggest \"stick\" right now in Cardano Governance is the NCL if you want to control budget amounts.  \n\nI have zero concerns right now about a total of 400-500M in budget proposal requests for a couple of reasons. It could be higher, shouldn't really matter. The checks/balances on that is the NCL at the end of the day.\n\n1 - Lack of support of 300M+ ADA NCL. Strong support for at least half of that, 150-250M ADA NCL likely imo.\n\n2 - Exhaustive pushback from a majority on most proposals suggests even if we had a 300M+ NCL most budget proposals will die to frugality."

          "originalText": "Maybe rather than tweeting about treasury spending at a high level, I can clarify what some of the spending is that I would actually vote YES for on-chain currently (ie not via off-chain processes, which I’m not a fan of), if asked to do so.\n\nAs always, please delegate to someone else if my approach is not in line with yours:\n\nNCL\nA reasonable NCL would in my mind ideally be below 150m, but to be pragmatic I’m willing to sign off on <= 200m. My reasons for this are well documented, but primarily relate to the emissions-price pressure-value add relationships.\n\nCore dev\nA reasonable proposal by IOG to keep delivering on critical roadmap items would get my instant support. In my view the one we have seen on gov tools ticks that box, if with a slightly hefty ask. Also assuming no surprises, I’d approve associated forks and changes. \n\nI am aware others besides IOG could do some of the work, but I think a safe approach in the first years of governance would be to only gradually diversify the work beyond IOG, rather than pull away from them immediately. Again, being conservative.\n\nHigh impact cost efficient proposals\nCost efficient, high impact technology efforts by other, ideally proven, actors. Think Midgard, Starstream or alternative nodes for single digit millions of ADA. Willing to entertain all similar impact and cost efficient ones.\n\nOrgs\nAssorted spending for Intersect and similar orgs pushing Cardano forward, if the asks are reasonable and well documented / detailed. Smaller asks will naturally be an easier yes.\n\nCatalyst and/or Intersect budget\nA slimmed down version of Catalyst to capture a lot of the efforts others want to put forward. Catalyst is a system that is not perfect, but is improving (eg quadratic voting) and is the current best framework we have for such things. Intersect might complement this, but needs to prove itself.\n\nSummary\nThis covers core tech, non core tech innovation, orgs and all the other proposals via Intersect/Catalyst.\n\nI think at a high level it should in principle be possible to fit all the above into a NCL of 150m ADA, though that would require some frugality on the part of all participants.\n\nMy stance on governance is that it should be transparent and on-chain wherever possible. I am currently unsure whether the Intersect budget process is as robust as what we have in place with Catalyst, and in any case it would need to prove itself.\n\nTherefore my preference would be to pull some of the tech related ones that I mentioned out of this process, and put them to a direct DRep vote fairly soon. Shrink down both Catalyst/Intersect budgets significantly and put them to a vote. I’ll likely support them."

          "text": "作為一名 DRep，我尚未對當前將2025年淨變化限額 (NCL) 設定為3.5億 ADA 的 GA 提案進行投票。我推遲投票的一個關鍵原因是我在等待一個設定較低 NCL 的替代提案——一個對我們第一個財政預算週期來說更合理和可持續的方案。\n\n我們之所以提出第二個提案，是因為第一個提案包含了多個大幅度的增長。雖然第二個提案解決了一些問題，但它也引入了新的複雜性，使包括我在內的許多 DReps 陷入困境。\n\n感覺好像有一種壓力，要我們僅僅因為第一個提案失敗就接受第二個提案。但這種想法是有缺陷的。僅僅因為一個提案沒有通过，並不意味著下一個提案，無論其缺陷如何，都應該被默認接受。\n\n我相信3.5億 ADA 太高了。我的立場是，一個更負責的範圍應該在1.5億到2億 ADA 之間。作為我們有史以來的第一個年度預算，我們必須從適度、現實的數字開始，并根據影響、效率和社群意見回饋的證據逐步擴大規模。\n\n是的，NCL 是一個上限，而不是支出的保證——但是一旦設定了上限，人性和機構行為往往會以達到上限為目標。現在批准3.5億可能會為未來更高的預算設定先例，無論資金是否得到有效利用。\n\n我相信社群應該得到第三個，更平衡的提案。它早就該提出了——我們這週就需要它。\n\n讓我們為財政治理奠定堅實的基礎。一個植根於問責制、可擴展性和社群共識的基礎。\n\n#CardanoCommunity #Cardanogovernance #DReps",

          "originalText": "As a DRep, I’ve not yet voted on the current GA proposal to set the 2025 Net Change Limit (NCL) at 350 million ADA. One key reason I’m holding off is in anticipation of an alternative proposal that sets a lower NCL—something more reasonable and sustainable for our first treasury budget cycle.\n\nWe arrived at a second proposal because the first included multiple steep increases. While the second addressed some concerns, it also introduced new complexities, leaving many DReps—myself included—in a difficult position.\n\nIt feels as though there's pressure to accept the second proposal simply because the first failed. But that mindset is flawed. Just because one proposal doesn't pass doesn’t mean the next one, regardless of its flaws, should be accepted by default.\n\nI believe 350M ADA is too high. My position is that a more responsible range would be between 150M and 200M ADA. As our first ever annual budget, we must start with modest, realistic figures and scale up based on evidence of impact, efficiency, and community feedback.\n\nYes, the NCL is a ceiling and not a guarantee of expenditure—but human nature and institutional behavior often aim for the ceiling once it’s in place. Approving 350M now could set the precedent for even higher future budgets, regardless of whether the funds are effectively used.\n\nI believe the community deserves a third, more balanced proposal. It’s overdue—and we need it this week.\n\nLet’s set a strong foundation for treasury governance. One rooted in accountability, scalability, and community consensus.\n\n#CardanoCommunity #Cardanogovernance #DReps"

Without the approved NCL, how do you expect teams like IOG or Midgard to cover ongoing development costs? Are you not concerned that this might slow down or even stall progress?\n\n• Catalyst Funding: The next Catalyst round is on hold, awaiting a budget decision. Essential ecosystem teams are already at risk of fighting for survival. Is that an acceptable trade-off?\n\n• Flexibility of Governance: Are you aware that a new Governance Action (GA) proposing a lower NCL can be submitted at any time? If so, why is NCL = 350M ADA perceived as so threatening?\n\n• Market Timing and Investment Windows: The current bull market won’t last forever. Now is the ideal time to mint stablecoins, run marketing campaigns, and support strategic initiatives. By the end of 2025, it may be too late. Isn’t it prudent to act while conditions are favorable?\n\n• Checks and Balances: Why assume total spending will automatically reach the NCL cap? DReps are tasked with voting on the budget and treasury withdrawals. ADA holders can monitor their choices and redelegate if necessary. Isn’t this an effective safeguard?\n\n• Misuse Isn’t Solved by NCL Alone: Even under a lower NCL, poorly designed or fraudulent projects may still get approved. Isn’t it more productive to focus on improving the quality of Budget Proposals rather than capping available funds?\n\n• Selling Pressure and Timing: Teams would receive a higher USD value if they sell ADA near an all-time high. While that scenario may still play out, the crypto market is notoriously unpredictable. Spreading withdrawals over time reduces sell pressure. Does it really make sense to delay spending until the end of 2025?\n\nI welcome constructive dialogue. My intent is not to polarize but to ensure that all dimensions of this decision are fully considered."

          "originalText": "@JaromirTesar \n\nScalability and Funding - Plan is still the same.  Last I checked both Midgard and IOG teams are still making good progress on things, despite the fact that we have not withdrawn from the Cardano treasury in a very long time.  I don't think another 6 weeks while we pursue a better will slow progress meaningfully.\n\nCatalyst Funding - I'm not aware of these ecosystem teams that are \"fighting for survival\".  Catalyst has already been funded up through F13.  And how would any of these projects know that they would be approved for funding anyways?  IMHO a 6-week delay is perfectly fine.\n\nFlexibility of Governance - I'm aware that a new NCL can be passed that is lower.  However, I worry that once we have a high NCL passed, many of the top dReps who happen to have budget proposals will rigorously defend the high limit so that their proposals have a better chance.  Better to approve a low NCL and then raise it later if we have to IMHO.\n\nMarket Timing and Investment Windows - I don't think any of the budget proposals mentioned so far move the needle enough in a positive direction to be worth the ADA they are asking for.  What is the PMF we are trying to market?  What strategic initiatives other than ones in IOG's core proposal, Midgard, Starstream, Amaru, and Gerolamo are needed?  All of those combined are still less than 200M ADA.  Also, I support a stablecoin liquidity proposal, but it needs to be decoupled from Emurgo's omnibus proposal IMHO.\n\nChecks and Balances - The issue here is not necessarily that dReps will want to spend up to the cap.  It's that budget proposers will.  We don't have enough visibility into ANY of the proposals' true costs.  Example:  Maybe with a 150M NCL, IOG might propose 50M for their core proposal.  With 350M NCL, there is enough room for them to ask for 100M first just to see if it passes.  We WANT budget proposers to be *LIMITED* by the NCL to get them to compete to lower costs.\n\nMisuse Isn’t Solved by NCL Alone - Agreed.  But IMHO lowering the NCL will cause proposers to increase the *quality* of their proposals in order to compete with other proposers for a slice of a smaller pie.\n\nSelling Pressure and Timing - ADA is currently 5x below ATH.  I very much doubt that it will be on its way back down again 6 weeks from now.  In fact I think if we delay a little bit we'll be more likely to stretch the value of our ADA spent to go much further.\n\nThese are some of the main reasons I am strongly against approving a 350M NCL right now."

We can't afford a governance deadlock. The ecosystem needs continuity, especially as we step into a new era of on-chain decision-making. 350M ₳ its still a huge number, I would be more comfortable with spending 250M ₳ in 2025.\n\nThat said, here's some nuance:\n\nThis should have been a percentage, not a fixed yearly number. A percentage of treasury inflows keeps us flexible and aligned with network growth. Hard limits age quickly and tie our hands — not great for dynamic environments like blockchain governance.\n\nI already voted NO on the 2025 + 2026 NCL combo proposal. Why? Because locking ourselves into 2026 without deeper analysis or flexibility is not a sustainable strategy for a new governance system. Each year should be modeled and discussed based on fresh data and needs — not bundled and rushed.\n\nWhile I’m voting YES on the 350M ₳ NCL for 2025, I plan to be disciplined in budget reviews. That means I’ll most likely supporting withdrawals up to 300M ₳ as a counterbalance, pushing for fiscal responsibility and impact-driven funding. Budgets tend to expand to its upper limit, that's why I'm doing this counterbalance. Although most likely a symbolic one.\n\nSo yes — this vote is strategic, not enthusiastic. It's about keeping Cardano moving while holding the line on value, accountability, and progress.\n\nVOTE0007"

We need an NCL. Voting on this Info Action is open right now: https://t.co/y2QhpF7s30\n\nAdditional thoughts:\n\n- Approving this limit is the shortest path to getting builders funded in the Cardano ecosystem. If we propose an arbitrarily smaller NCL info action, it will need to go through approval and will delay this process by another month. \n\n- This NCL creates a cap of what we can possibly spend in the coming year. This does not mean we are approving a ₳350M withdrawal (or any withdrawal at this time) from the Cardano Treasury.\n\n- This Info Action already has 50%+ approval from the DReps, and its approval allows us to start the process of funding projects building on Cardano.\n\n-  This net change limit value is about equivalent to the income of the Cardano Treasury in the past year. From January 5th, 2024, Epoch 459, through December 30th, Epoch 531, the actual total income into the Cardano Treasury was 335,957,093 ada. So this NCL essentially states that we will not spend more than what we made last year. I think that’s a pretty reasonable statement.\n\n- Just as easily as we are having a vote now, we can vote to revise the NCL in 2026. I would expect that the DReps will vote to adjust the NCL appropriately over time to ensure sustainable deployment of the Cardano Treasury. \n\n- There is a balance between ‘spending and being wasteful’ versus ‘not spending and constraining the ecosystem.’ This NCL puts a reasonable guardrail on those discussions."

Blockchain was conceived to solve the distribution of control problem. No network has fully lived up to that challenge yet, and it remains a problem we desperately need to solve.\nCardano is the closest to fulfilling the true destiny of blockchain, but we will only succeed if we learn to manage resources and make complex decisions.\nWe will not learn that by acting so cautiously that we never take risks. We need the freedom to make mistakes — and an NCL as low as ₳200M does not grant us that freedom.\n\nOur responsibility is to manage the treasury wisely, not to avoid risk out of fear.\nWe need to accept that we will make mistakes, and that's okay — because we will address them and learn from them.\nBecause that's how we get better.\n\nMatthew 25:14–30"

          "text": "我投票反對將淨變化限額 (NCL) 降至2億 ADA，這是迄今為止最艱難的治理決策之一。\n\n感覺這裡似乎沒有完全好的選擇。\n\n而且，我自己也曾呼籲降低 NCL。\n\n目前3.5億 ADA 的 NCL 存在一些顯著的缺點。\n\n如果巨大的拋售壓力導致 ADA 價格大幅下跌，比如說跌至0.2美元，則可能導致嚴重挑戰。\n\n以美元計價資助生態系統將需要從財政庫出售大量 ADA，從而導致拋售壓力的螺旋式上升，使情況惡化。\n\nCardano Whale (@cardano_whale) 指出，像 Tezos 和 Polkadot 這樣的一些項目在其生態系統中投入了大量資金，擁有創新技術，但仍難以獲得實質性關注。\n\n我完全同意這一點。\n\n對於區塊鏈而言，保持在市值排名前十的位置至關重要。\n\n散戶投資者、機構和加密貨幣愛好者不僅根據技術，還根據市場表現來評估項目。\n\n如果 Cardano 長期跌出前十，無論其去中心化程度或像 Ouroboros Leios 這樣的技術進步如何，它可能永遠無法恢復其地位。\n\n這是一個需要考慮的重要因素，即使感覺不公平或主觀。\n\n另一方面，將 NCL 降至2億 ADA 也帶來了一系列擔憂。\n\nCardano 需要投資來推進其技術，支持建設者，並發展生態系統。如果沒有增加的用戶活動，財政庫收入將無法增長。\n\n未來幾年在維護和開發上的支出可能會耗盡儲備金，最終使 Cardano 在經濟上不可持續。\n\n協議安全性也取決於有吸引力的權益獎勵和激勵措施。此外，如果沒有活躍的開發者、工具和不斷發展的 DeFi 生態系統，Ouroboros Leios 的潛力將無法發揮。所有這些領域的投資都至關重要。\n\nIOG 已經明確了他們的資金需求：核心開發需要9600萬 ADA，Catalyst 需要6900萬 ADA，研究需要2700萬 ADA。總計1.92億 ADA。IOG 的提議很簡單：要麼批准這筆資金，要麼就此作罷。\n\n關於公平性、IOG 和 Charles 過去的貢獻以及 Cardano「完成」定義的辯論有其道理，但現實是 IOG 在協議方面擁有無與倫比的專業知識。沒有其他實體能夠以相同的速度或品質有效地接管維護、開發和研究。\n\n如果 DReps 將1.92億 ADA 分配給 IOG，那麼其他項目只剩下800萬 ADA。\n\n在審查了預算提案後，我只支持了我認為生態系統絕對需要的基本項目：像 Midgard、Starstream、Hydra、ZK Rollups、Blockfrost、Lucid、Chainlink 集成等項目。\n\n僅 CORE 類別一項，就大約需要1200萬 ADA。在所有類別中，我批准的總預算達到2.13億 ADA。\n\n鑑於我自己估計所需支出為2.13億 ADA，我不能支持2億 ADA 的 NCL。\n\n這將與我在必要項目資金和我批准的上限方面的立場相矛盾。這種不一致性引導我投票反對降低 NCL。\n\nCardano 需要有效的行銷和改進的治理支持，因為目前的情況遠非理想。\n\n投資生態系統和推進新技術必須齊頭並進，以確保可持續增長。\n\n在我看來，批准2億 ADA 的 NCL 意味著維持現狀，將所有關鍵職責留給 IOG，同時忽視對更廣泛生態系統的投資。\n\n從本質上講，這將限制對與 IOG 一樣對生態系統至關重要的實體的資助。\n\n關於 NCL 的預期情景是一個重要的考量因素。\n\n在我看來，3.5億 ADA 和2億 ADA 的 NCL 都是極端的。\n\n目前的 NCL 定為3.5億 ADA，得到了76%的投票權益的強烈支持。幾乎所有的投票權益都批准了它。將 NCL 從3.5億大幅降低到2億 ADA，要麼是不負責任的，要麼是過於雄心勃勃的。\n\n接下來會發生什麼？建設者、Intersect、IOG 或其他人可能會提交一項新的治理行動，提議一個中間的 NCL，可能是2.5億或3億 ADA。或者，可能會同時提交多個提案。\n\n這種情況會造成一個不穩定的環境，這是適得其反且難以支持的。這種不穩定性會破壞進展。\n\n此外，加密社群對 Cardano 生態系統能負擔多少投資的冗長辯論興趣不大。\n\n在不穩定的環境中，即使提出一個連貫的預算也幾乎是不可能的。\n\n目前，我們的 NCL 是3.5億 ADA。考慮一下這個可能的情景：\n\nIntersect 預計將提交一項針對6月份到期預算的治理行動。與此同時，如果5月底批准了新的2億 ADA NCL，那麼除非在新的 NCL 生效前獲得批准，否則提議的預算實際上將變得違憲。\n\n這使得過程複雜化，並進一步凸顯了突然、極端變化帶來的問題。\n\n透過治理行動來辯論 NCL 既低效又耗時。\n\n社群的共識似乎很可能在2.5億至3億 ADA 之間。然而，在鏈上投票之前，沒有進行過（大多數社群會回應的）鏈下溫度測試，這導致了目前的 NCL 僅僅為了讓預算過程繼續下去而被批准。\n\nNCL 的概念本身開始讓人覺得沒有必要，因為它總是根據多數票而變化。如果投票權益同意增加或減少 NCL，這不可避免地會發生。\n\n重要的是要強調，NCL 並不決定必須從財政庫中支出的金額。每一項提款提案仍然需要社群的批准。\n\n如果目前的提案在2.5億至3億 ADA 的範圍內，我可能會投贊成票。如果提交了這樣的提案，我會支持它，因為它符合我認為基於我已認可的提案的合理預算。\n\n然而，我的決定並非最終決定，可能會根據未來治理方面的發展而改變。\n\n例如，如果治理行動將多個提案合併導致總成本過高，或者如果 IOG 提案與我不支持的幾個提案或我強烈反對的一個提案（例如 Daedalus 2025 服務增強）組合在一起，我可能會重新考慮我的立場。\n\n如果防止不良預算結果的唯一方法是投票支持較低的 NCL，我準備這樣做。這個決定是微妙的，不能非黑即白地看待。\n\n我希望避免出現批准較低 NCL 不可避免地導致再次提交 GA 的情況。反覆處理 NCL 既耗時又沒有成效。\n\nDReps 需要優先考慮預算提案。\n\n如果一個較高的 NCL 最終資助了預算內品質低劣的項目，那麼它就毫無意義。\n\n我的 DRep ID：\ndrep1km69g7ksf8t5g0h9d9tkrcd2tezxelx0wtr76rv2mrkl5nzd6v3",

          "originalText": "I voted NO ⛔️to reduce the Net Change Limit (NCL) to 200M ADA, which has been one of the toughest governance decisions so far. \n\nIt feels like there’s no entirely good option here.\n\nMoreover, I myself called for a lower NCL.\n\nThe current NCL of 350M ADA has some notable drawbacks.\n\nIf high selling pressure causes ADA’s price to drop significantly, say to 0.2 USD, it could result in serious challenges. \n\nFunding the ecosystem in dollar terms would require selling a large amount of ADA from the treasury, leading to a spiral of selling pressure that could worsen the situation.\n\nCardano Whale (@cardano_whale) pointed out that some projects like Tezos and Polkadot have invested heavily in their ecosystems, possess innovative technologies, yet struggle to gain substantial attention.\n\nI fully agree with that.\n\nFor blockchains, maintaining a presence in the top 10 market capitalization rankings is vital.\n\nRetail investors, institutions, and crypto enthusiasts evaluate projects not only based on technology but also on market performance. \n\nIf Cardano drops out of the top 10 for an extended period, it may never regain its position, regardless of decentralization or technological progress like Ouroboros Leios. \n\nThis is an important factor to consider, even if it feels unfair or subjective.\n\nOn the other hand, reducing the NCL to 200M ADA comes with its own set of concerns.\n\nCardano needs investments to advance its technology, support builders, and develop the ecosystem. Without increased user activity, Treasury revenue won't grow. \n\nSpending on maintenance and development in the next years risks exhausting the reserve, ultimately making Cardano economically unsustainable.\n\nProtocol security also hinges on attractive staking rewards and incentives. Moreover, Ouroboros Leios’s potential will remain untapped without active developers, tools, and a growing DeFi ecosystem. Investments in all these areas are crucial.\n\nIOG has made their funding requirements clear: Core Dev needs 96M ADA, Catalyst 69M ADA, and Research 27M ADA. Combined, this totals 192M ADA. The offer from IOG is simple: either approve this funding or let it be.\n\nDebates around fairness, IOG and Charles’s past contributions, and the definition of “completion” for Cardano have their place, but the reality is that IOG holds unmatched expertise in the protocol. No other entity can effectively take over maintenance, development, and research at the same pace or quality.\n\nIf DReps allocate 192M ADA to IOG, only 8M ADA remains for other projects.\n\nAfter reviewing budget proposals, I supported only the essentials I believe the ecosystem absolutely needs: projects like Midgard, Starstream, Hydra, ZK Rollups, Blockfrost, Lucid, Chainlink integration, and others. \n\nFor the CORE category alone, this amounts to around 12M ADA. Across all categories, my total approved budget comes to 213M ADA.\n\nGiven my own estimate of required expenditures is 213M ADA, I cannot support an NCL of 200M ADA. \n\nIt would contradict my stance on necessary project funding versus the cap I approve. This inconsistency guided my decision to vote NO on reducing the NCL.\n\nCardano requires effective marketing and improved governance support, as the current situation is far from ideal.\n\nInvesting in the ecosystem and advancing new technologies must go hand in hand to ensure sustainable growth.\n\nApproving the NCL of 200M ADA, in my view, would mean preserving the status quo, leaving all key responsibilities to IOG while neglecting investment in the broader ecosystem. \n\nEssentially, it would restrict funding for entities that are vital to the ecosystem, just as IOG is.\n\nAn important consideration is the expected scenarios surrounding the NCL.\n\nBoth NCLs, an NCL of 350M ADA and 200M ADA, are extremes in my view.\n\nThe current NCL, set at 350M ADA, has strong support with 76% of the voting stake participating. Nearly the entire voting stake approved it. Drastically reducing the NCL from 350M to 200M ADA would be either irresponsible or overly ambitious.\n\nWhat would happen next? Builders, Intersect, IOG, or others would likely submit a new governance action proposing an intermediate NCL, perhaps 250M or 300M ADA. Alternatively, multiple proposals could be submitted simultaneously.\n\nThis scenario would create an unstable environment that is counterproductive and difficult to support. Such instability undermines progress.\n\nMoreover, the crypto community has little interest in prolonged debates about how much the Cardano ecosystem can afford to invest.\n\nIn an unstable environment, even proposing a coherent budget becomes nearly impossible.\n\nCurrently, we have an NCL of 350M ADA. Consider this likely scenario:\n\nIntersect is expected to submit a governance action for the budget expiring in June. Meanwhile, if a new NCL of 200M ADA is approved by the end of May, the proposed budget would effectively become unconstitutional unless it is approved before the new NCL takes effect. \n\nThis complicates the process and further highlights the issues with sudden, extreme changes.\n\nDebating the NCL through governance actions is both inefficient and overly time-consuming.\n\nIt seems likely that the community's consensus would fall somewhere between 250M–300M ADA. However, no off-chain temperature check was conducted (to which the majority of the community would respond) before the on-chain vote, which led to the current NCL being approved simply to allow the budgeting process to continue.\n\nThe concept of the NCL itself is starting to feel unnecessary, as it constantly shifts based on the majority vote. If the voting stake agrees to increase or decrease the NCL, it will inevitably happen.\n\nIt’s important to emphasize that the NCL doesn’t dictate the amount that must be spent from the treasury. Every withdrawal proposal still requires approval from the community.\n\nI would likely vote YES if the current proposal fell within the 250M–300M ADA range. If a proposal like this is submitted, I would support it, as it aligns with the budget I consider reasonable based on the proposals I have endorsed.\n\nHowever, my decision isn’t final and may change depending on future developments in governance. \n\nFor instance, if governance actions combine multiple proposals that result in an excessively high total cost, or if the IOG proposal is grouped with several proposals I don’t support, or one I strongly oppose, such as the Daedalus 2025 Service Enhancement, I might reconsider my stance.\n\nIf the only way to prevent a poor budget outcome is to vote for a lower NCL, I am prepared to do so. This decision is nuanced and cannot be seen in black-and-white terms.\n\nI want to avoid a scenario where approving a lower NCL inevitably results in another GA submission. Addressing the NCL repeatedly is time-consuming and unproductive. \n\nDReps need to prioritize budget proposals instead.\n\nA higher NCL serves no purpose if it ends up funding low-quality projects within the budget.\n\nMy DRep ID:\ndrep1km69g7ksf8t5g0h9d9tkrcd2tezxelx0wtr76rv2mrkl5nzd6v3"

Setting the NCL at 200M ADA would nearly exhaust the limit, leaving little room for funding other critical infrastructure proposals. This situation risks hindering Cardano’s growth.\n\nFundamentally, the NCL is not a budget intended to be fully spent, but rather a guardrail that defines the maximum amount that may be withdrawn within a given period. As we are still in the early stages of transitioning to on-chain governance, imposing a restrictive cap at this time could undermine the flexibility needed for effective decision-making and timely response.\n\nMoreover, the NCL is not fixed permanently once established. It should be subject to review and adjustment as budget execution progresses and as market conditions evolve.\n\nIn this transitional period, it is prudent to design with sufficient margin to accommodate uncertainty. Doing so will support sustainable and strategic ecosystem governance.\n\n#Cardano #ADA #Drep"

          "originalText": "As Cardano’s 2025 budget process gains momentum, multiple proposals have emerged to reassess the Net Change Limit (NCL). Here’s a breakdown of the current situation:\n\n✅ Approved: The 2025 NCL of 350M ADA has been formally ratified by DReps. It’s based on a 2024 treasury income model (approx. 336M ADA) and now serves as the foundation for current budget deliberations.\n\n❌ Rejected: A more conservative proposal to cap 2025 at 300M ADA and 2026 at 250M ADA was not approved.\n\n🟠 Under Review:\n“2025 Cardano NCL” proposes lowering the NCL to 200M ADA, urging a cautious approach during this first year of decentralized treasury governance.\n“300M ADA for Epochs 563–635” aims to establish an NCL for early 2026, supporting budget continuity across overlapping periods.\n\nMeanwhile, several new funding proposals have been submitted:\n\n1⃣ 7.5M ADA for Community Builder Proposals — includes only those with ≥2.69B ADA support, excluding proposals from Intersect and founding entities.\n\n2⃣ 1.5M ADA for Amaru Rust Node Development — a PRAGMA-led initiative to diversify Cardano nodes and enhance network resilience.\n\n3⃣ 50M ADA for DeFi Liquidity — aims to seed liquidity into DEXs and stablecoins, with yield partially returned to the treasury.\n\nAs SIPO DRep, we’re evaluating these developments based on:\n\n🔍 Cautious governance: supports the 200M ADA NCL.\n🚀 Growth & momentum: supports maintaining the 350M ADA cap.\n⚖️ Balanced compromise: 300M ADA could be a pragmatic middle ground.\n\nFor funding proposals, our assessment will focus on:\nDoes it generate a return to the treasury?\nIs transparency and execution capacity ensured?\nDoes it set a strong precedent for the first year of decentralized financial governance?\n\nThe NCL is more than just a number — it reflects Cardano’s financial philosophy and growth trajectory. Changing the cap directly impacts which proposals are viable.\n\nWe’ll soon publish SIPO’s evaluation criteria and vote logic for each major proposal.

      "content": "本理由支持 Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem 預算資訊行動——一項總額為 275,269,340 ada 的撥款，分配給39項提案，每項提案均獲得了超過50%參與 DRep 權益的支持（38億 ada 的實時權益，佔活躍委託權益的70%以上，不包括預定義投票選項）。\n\n**提案接收與整合**\n\n在2025年4月1日  – 5月5日期間，Intersect 的 Cardano Budget Committee 通過兩個渠道接受資金申請：\n\n- 與 Intersect 多個委員會（產品、開源、治理、行銷、研究）相關的委員會“整筆預算”，與願景和產品路線圖保持一致。\n- 來自任何 Cardano貢獻者的開放式社區提交，無論其是否為 Intersect 成員。\n\n所有194份提交都遵循標準模板（問題、益處、路線圖一致性、成本），並可通過委員會反饋進行完善，在 DRep 審查前同時涵蓋自上而下的戰略和自下而上的創新。\n\n**社區信號**\n\nDRep 和 ada 持有者通過兩輪鏈下投票表達了他們的偏好：一次初步的 GovTool 調查和一次最終的 Ekklesia“意向摸底”投票（截止時間為2025年5月5日23:59 UTC）。獲得超過50%參與 DRep 權益支持並選擇 Intersect 作為其管理人的提案進入了本預算資訊行動。投票產出物已公開（見下文參考資料）。所有提案內容在“意向摸底”投票結束時均已打上時間戳，並作為本次鏈上提交的一部分發布到 IPFS，從而創建了不可篡改的記錄。\n\n**鏈上批准與監督**\n\n**預算資訊行動與 Net Change Limit**\n\n這39項符合資格的提案已被捆綁到此單一預算資訊行動中，供 DRep 批准。截至2025年5月8日，雖然請求的總資金低於當前生效的 Net Change Limit (NCL)——350萬億 lovelace（即3.5億 ada），但 NCL 本身可隨時通過單獨的資訊行動進行修訂。因此，每次後續的國庫提款都必須在符合屆時有效的 NCL 的情況下提交並獲得批准，這符合 Cardano Constitution 第四條和 Guardrail: TREASURY-02a 的規定。\n\n儘管所有入選提案均已請求 Intersect 作為其管理人，但此指定並非自動保證。在任何國庫提款治理行動之前，提案人將被要求接受盡職調查，包括 KYC/KYB 及其他背景和驗證檢查。如果提案未能滿足這些要求，Intersect 保留拒絕或撤回其管理人角色的權利，並自行酌情決定。\n\n**國庫提款與資金管理**\n\n一旦獲得批准，Intersect——在此預算撥款所含的每項提案中均被指定為管理人——將提交國庫提款治理行動，供 DRep 批准從 Cardano Treasury 發放資金。保障措施包括：\n\n- 在可能且適用的情況下，使用由 Intersect、獨立審計方和其他指定機構簽署的多重簽名控制的智能合約去中心化託管。該功能正由 Sundae Labs 開發。\n- 從智能合約或相關帳戶的資金支付將按照提案的合同條款執行，並接受定期監督、報告以及（如適用）里程碑驗收。這些資訊將通過新的社區儀表板公開。\n- 審計和暫停支付功能允許在違反合同條款時暫停資金。仲裁後，智能合約或相關帳戶中任何未支付的剩餘資金將被退回 Cardano Treasury。\n- 鏈上透明度：每筆付款均可公開追溯，Intersect 的交付保障團隊將與當選委員會合作發布進展報告，供社區監督。\n\n**成果**\n\n通過社區信號、DRep 批准、適應性的 NCL 合規以及智能合約監督（在適用和可用的情況下），Cardano 可以充滿信心地為2025年路線圖及支持性舉措提供資金——負責任地分配國庫資源，同時保持適應未來經濟參數的靈活性。\n\nCardano Constitution 中規定的條款聲明，Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem 預算的批准需要超過50%的活躍投票 DRep 權益的閾值，並且 Constitutional Committee 成員應在鏈上記錄投票，闡明其對擬議預算（如果按“資訊”行動中所含形式實施）是否會違反本 Constitution 的意見。因此，本預算資訊行動將在 DRep 投票達到或超過 50% +1 lovelace，且 Constitutional Committee （7名成員中的至少5名）投票認定該預算不違反本 Constitution 的情況下，被視為通過。",

          "abstract": "On behalf of Intersect and the Cardano Budget Committee, this Budget Info Action proposes a Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Budget of 275,269,340 ada. The period during which this Budget Info Action remains in effect will begin at the close of its voting period and continue for 73 epochs (52 weeks). This budget is an aggregate allocation and following Treasury Withdrawal(s) must be in compliance with an approved and active Net Change Limit, among other conditions. This budget comprises 39 proposals that support maintenance, development, marketing, innovation, and governance initiatives within the Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem.\n\nTo arrive at this budget, Intersect facilitated a community budget submission process, using live DRep stake to assess and validate support through the Ekklesia platform. More than 3.8B ada in voting stake participated, representing over 70% of actively delegated stake (excluding pre-defined voting options). A total of 194 proposals were submitted as part of Intersect’s coordination efforts for budget socialization. Projects that received over 50% support by stake from participating DReps, and named Intersect as their Administrator, have been included in this Budget Info Action. Of the 194 proposals submitted, 40 met the required support threshold, and 39 of these named Intersect as their Administrator. Any proposals that proceeded directly on-chain outside of this Budget Info Action have been excluded from ours.\n\nAll proposals listed below have requested Intersect as their Administrator, who will oversee and administer the use of funds from Cardano Blockchain Treasury withdrawals in accordance with this budget and the requirements of the Cardano Constitution. This includes leveraging blockchain technology such as smart contracts as per Article IV, Section 2 in the Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Constitution. Intersect, in our role as an Administrator for the included proposals in this aggregate budget, will - wherever possible and available - utilize a smart contract framework to oversee disbursements including a multi-signature oversight body made up of organizations and auditors, one of which will be Intersect in our role as Administrator.",
          "rationale": "This rationale underpins the Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Budget Info Action - an aggregate allocation of 275,269,340 ada across 39 proposals that each won >50% of participating DRep stake (3.8B ada in live stake >70% of actively delegated stake excluding pre-defined voting options).\n\n**Proposal Intake & Consolidation**\n\nBetween 1 April  – 5 May 2025, the Cardano Budget Committee at Intersect accepted funding requests through two streams:\n\n- Committee “block budgets” connected to several Intersect committees (product, open source, governance, marketing, research) aligned to the vision and product roadmap.\n- Open community submissions from any Cardano contributor, regardless of Intersect membership.\n\nAll 194 submissions followed a standard template (problem, benefits, roadmap alignment, cost) and could be refined with committee feedback, capturing both top-down strategy and bottom-up innovation before DRep review.\n\n**Community Signalling**\n\nDReps and ada holders expressed their preferences in two rounds of off-chain polling: an initial GovTool survey and a final Ekklesia “temperature-check” poll that closed at 23:59 UTC on 5 May 2025. Proposals that garnered over 50% of the participating DRep stake and selected Intersect as their Administrator advanced to this Budget Info Action. The poll artefacts are publicly available (see references below). All proposal content was timestamped at the close of the temperature-check poll and now published to IPFS as part of this on-chain submission, creating an immutable record.\n\n**On-Chain Approval & Oversight**\n\n**Budget Info Action & Net Change Limit**\n\nThe 39 qualifying proposals have been bundled into this single Budget Info Action for DRep ratification. While the total requested funding sits below the Net Change Limit (NCL) currently in force, 350 trillion lovelace, or 350 million ada, as of 8 May 2025, the NCL itself can be amended by a separate Info Action at any time. Consequently, each subsequent Treasury Withdrawal must be presented and approved only if it remains within the then-active NCL, in line with Article IV of the Cardano Constitution and Guardrail: TREASURY-02a.\n\nAlthough all included proposals have requested Intersect as their Administrator, this designation is not automatically guaranteed. Ahead of any Treasury Withdrawal governance action, proposers will be required to undergo due diligence, including KYC/KYB and other background and verification checks. Intersect reserves the right to decline or withdraw its role as Administrator if a proposal fails to meet these requirements, and remains at its discretion.\n\n**Treasury Withdrawal & Fund Management**\n\nOnce ratified, Intersect - named as the Administrator in every proposal included in this budget allocation - will submit Treasury Withdrawal governance action(s) for DReps to approve the release of funds from the Cardano Treasury. Safeguards include:\n\n- Wherever possible and applicable, multi-sig controlled smart-contract decentralized escrow with signers from Intersect, independent auditors, and other appointed bodies. Being developed by Sundae Labs.\n- Disbursements from smart contracts or related accounts will be executed in line with the proposal’s contractual terms and subject to regular oversight, reporting, and - where applicable - milestone acceptance. These will be public via a new community dashboard.\n- Audit and pause-payment capability allow funds to be paused if contractual terms are breached. After arbitration, any undisbursed funds remaining in the smart contract or related accounts will be returned to the Cardano Treasury.\n- On-chain transparency: every payment is publicly traceable, and Intersect’s delivery assurance team working with elected committees will publish progress reports for community oversight.\n\n**Outcome**\n\nThrough community signalling, DRep ratification, adaptable NCL compliance, and smart-contract oversight (wherever applicable and available), Cardano can fund the 2025 roadmap and supporting initiatives confidently - allocating Treasury resources responsibly while retaining the agility to adapt to future economic parameters.\n\nThe provisions set forth in the Cardano Constitution state that the approval of a Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem budget requires a threshold of greater than 50% of the active voting DRep stake and that Constitutional Committee members shall record a vote on-chain that sets forth their opinion as to whether the proposed budget, if it were to be implemented in the form contained in the “Info” action, would violate this Constitution. Therefore, this Budget Info Action will be considered passed with a DRep vote of greater than or equal to 50% +1 lovelace and a Constitutional Committee vote of at least 5 of 7 members.",
          "motivation": "On March 30, the Cardano community approved the “Defining the Cardano Vision and Roadmap for 2025 and Beyond” Info Action, establishing the foundations for building and anchoring a budget to support its delivery. The budget socialization process - facilitated by Intersect in collaboration with the Cardano community and DRep participation - was designed to be inclusive, with no formal criteria required to take part.

        "abstract": "On behalf of Intersect and the Cardano Budget Committee, this Budget Info Action proposes a Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Budget of 275,269,340 ada. The period during which this Budget Info Action remains in effect will begin at the close of its voting period and continue for 73 epochs (52 weeks). This budget is an aggregate allocation and following Treasury Withdrawal(s) must be in compliance with an approved and active Net Change Limit, among other conditions. This budget comprises 39 proposals that support maintenance, development, marketing, innovation, and governance initiatives within the Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem.\n\nTo arrive at this budget, Intersect facilitated a community budget submission process, using live DRep stake to assess and validate support through the Ekklesia platform. More than 3.8B ada in voting stake participated, representing over 70% of actively delegated stake (excluding pre-defined voting options). A total of 194 proposals were submitted as part of Intersect’s coordination efforts for budget socialization. Projects that received over 50% support by stake from participating DReps, and named Intersect as their Administrator, have been included in this Budget Info Action. Of the 194 proposals submitted, 40 met the required support threshold, and 39 of these named Intersect as their Administrator. Any proposals that proceeded directly on-chain outside of this Budget Info Action have been excluded from ours.\n\nAll proposals listed below have requested Intersect as their Administrator, who will oversee and administer the use of funds from Cardano Blockchain Treasury withdrawals in accordance with this budget and the requirements of the Cardano Constitution. This includes leveraging blockchain technology such as smart contracts as per Article IV, Section 2 in the Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Constitution. Intersect, in our role as an Administrator for the included proposals in this aggregate budget, will - wherever possible and available - utilize a smart contract framework to oversee disbursements including a multi-signature oversight body made up of organizations and auditors, one of which will be Intersect in our role as Administrator.",

        "rationale": "This rationale underpins the Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Budget Info Action - an aggregate allocation of 275,269,340 ada across 39 proposals that each won >50% of participating DRep stake (3.8B ada in live stake >70% of actively delegated stake excluding pre-defined voting options).\n\n**Proposal Intake & Consolidation**\n\nBetween 1 April  – 5 May 2025, the Cardano Budget Committee at Intersect accepted funding requests through two streams:\n\n- Committee “block budgets” connected to several Intersect committees (product, open source, governance, marketing, research) aligned to the vision and product roadmap.\n- Open community submissions from any Cardano contributor, regardless of Intersect membership.\n\nAll 194 submissions followed a standard template (problem, benefits, roadmap alignment, cost) and could be refined with committee feedback, capturing both top-down strategy and bottom-up innovation before DRep review.\n\n**Community Signalling**\n\nDReps and ada holders expressed their preferences in two rounds of off-chain polling: an initial GovTool survey and a final Ekklesia “temperature-check” poll that closed at 23:59 UTC on 5 May 2025. Proposals that garnered over 50% of the participating DRep stake and selected Intersect as their Administrator advanced to this Budget Info Action. The poll artefacts are publicly available (see references below). All proposal content was timestamped at the close of the temperature-check poll and now published to IPFS as part of this on-chain submission, creating an immutable record.\n\n**On-Chain Approval & Oversight**\n\n**Budget Info Action & Net Change Limit**\n\nThe 39 qualifying proposals have been bundled into this single Budget Info Action for DRep ratification. While the total requested funding sits below the Net Change Limit (NCL) currently in force, 350 trillion lovelace, or 350 million ada, as of 8 May 2025, the NCL itself can be amended by a separate Info Action at any time. Consequently, each subsequent Treasury Withdrawal must be presented and approved only if it remains within the then-active NCL, in line with Article IV of the Cardano Constitution and Guardrail: TREASURY-02a.\n\nAlthough all included proposals have requested Intersect as their Administrator, this designation is not automatically guaranteed. Ahead of any Treasury Withdrawal governance action, proposers will be required to undergo due diligence, including KYC/KYB and other background and verification checks. Intersect reserves the right to decline or withdraw its role as Administrator if a proposal fails to meet these requirements, and remains at its discretion.\n\n**Treasury Withdrawal & Fund Management**\n\nOnce ratified, Intersect - named as the Administrator in every proposal included in this budget allocation - will submit Treasury Withdrawal governance action(s) for DReps to approve the release of funds from the Cardano Treasury. Safeguards include:\n\n- Wherever possible and applicable, multi-sig controlled smart-contract decentralized escrow with signers from Intersect, independent auditors, and other appointed bodies. Being developed by Sundae Labs.\n- Disbursements from smart contracts or related accounts will be executed in line with the proposal’s contractual terms and subject to regular oversight, reporting, and - where applicable - milestone acceptance. These will be public via a new community dashboard.\n- Audit and pause-payment capability allow funds to be paused if contractual terms are breached. After arbitration, any undisbursed funds remaining in the smart contract or related accounts will be returned to the Cardano Treasury.\n- On-chain transparency: every payment is publicly traceable, and Intersect’s delivery assurance team working with elected committees will publish progress reports for community oversight.\n\n**Outcome**\n\nThrough community signalling, DRep ratification, adaptable NCL compliance, and smart-contract oversight (wherever applicable and available), Cardano can fund the 2025 roadmap and supporting initiatives confidently - allocating Treasury resources responsibly while retaining the agility to adapt to future economic parameters.\n\nThe provisions set forth in the Cardano Constitution state that the approval of a Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem budget requires a threshold of greater than 50% of the active voting DRep stake and that Constitutional Committee members shall record a vote on-chain that sets forth their opinion as to whether the proposed budget, if it were to be implemented in the form contained in the “Info” action, would violate this Constitution. Therefore, this Budget Info Action will be considered passed with a DRep vote of greater than or equal to 50% +1 lovelace and a Constitutional Committee vote of at least 5 of 7 members.",

        "myOpinion": "考量到Cardano推進其技術基礎設施（Hydra、Leios、Layer 2解決方案）並培育一個繁榮、有競爭力的生態系統的戰略必要性，一項大規模、協調的資助計畫無疑是必需的。該提案旨在透過實施社群對39個專案的訊號偏好來解決這個問題，並由Intersect履行憲法規定的管理職責。\n\n然而，擬議的機制——對39個不同提案進行一次性的、捆綁式的2.75億ADA投票——帶來了嚴重的治理和戰略風險。這種「全有或全無」的方法嚴重限制了DRep的精細監督，可能導致將較低優先級的專案與關鍵專案一同資助，從而妨礙了有效的資本配置。當Cardano的戰略強調需要「為優秀工程支付溢價」並專注於核心技術進步時，這一點尤其令人擔憂。社群就DRep諮詢、投票透明度和Ekklesia流程中的門檻計算所提出的程序性擔憂，也削弱了這一聚合行動的合法性。\n\n雖然不實施這一特定的捆綁提案可能會導致資金的短期延遲，但它提供了一個關鍵的機會來改進流程，以實現更大的DRep賦權、透明度和戰略一致性。錯誤分配如此巨額資金的潛在負面影響——包括ADA貶值和損害社群信任——超過了在這種情況下追求權宜之計的好處。\n\n因此，我**反對**目前這種捆綁形式的提案。\n\n我的理由基於以下原則：\n1.  **戰略一致性與效率**：對39個不同提案進行捆綁投票，難以確保資金主要用於Cardano的核心技術目標，如Leios、Hydra和L2擴容解決方案。更精細的方法將有助於更好地實現一致性，並確保資源集中在能夠產生最高長期戰略價值的領域。\n2.  **DRep問責制與精細監督**：捆綁方法削弱了DReps對個別提案做出明智判斷的能力，而這對於健全的去中心化治理至關重要。\n3.  **透明度與合法性**：社群強調的程序模糊性和DRep諮詢缺乏的問題必須得到解決，以確保Cardano治理流程的長期健康和合法性。\n4.  **長期可持續性**：雖然眼前的資金很重要，但建立健全、透明和負責任的融資機制對於Cardano的戰略可持續性更為關鍵。為此類巨額資金接受一個有缺陷的流程會開創一個不良先例。\n\n更可取的做法是，將提案分解為更小、主題更連貫的組合包，或允許對單個提案進行批准，同時明確解決程序上的擔憂。這將促進更廣泛的DRep參與，確保更有針對性的資金與Cardano的戰略技術重點保持一致，並在治理體系中建立更強大的社群信任，即使這最初可能需要更多時間。"

          "text": "關於Cardano預算的一些觀察。\n\n我對2.667億ADA的總預算感到滿意。我預期收入會更高（約3.2億ADA），所以我們很可能在未來幾年節省下ADA。\n\n處於牛市有幾個原因讓我們有理由增加投資。\n\n隨著ADA市場價格的上漲，用較少數量的ADA幣獲得更高的美元價值成為可能。\n\n此外，明智的投資可以吸引新用戶加入生態系統。預期用戶活躍度將在2026年中期下降。\n\n為接下來三個Catalyst基金（每個基金2000萬ADA）僅撥款6000万ADA的可能原因是ADA的市場價格較高。\n\n我發現預算中缺失的是對DeFi的投資和穩定幣的鑄造。\n\n我設想每個epoch鑄造100-200萬穩定幣，例如USDM和DJED。如果整個牛市期間ADA的平均價格為1美元，成本將在1.4億美元左右，這大約相當於1.4億ADA。\n\n然而，如果ADA的平均價格更高，比如2美元，那麼ADA價值的成本將減半。\n\n預算計算1 ADA等於0.5美元。這在我看來是不夠的。\n\n這是一個我們應該討論和考慮的話題。\n\n目前的預算可以減少嗎？我們可以不同地分配ADA嗎？\n\n我不想在不了解所有細節的情況下逐條批評高昂的成本。我將憑常識判斷。\n\n歡迎隨時糾正我或提供重要背景資訊。\n\n鏈上治理對我來說似乎過於昂貴。雖然DReps可以對治理行動進行投票，但Intersect和各種委員會將花費我們數千萬的ADA。\n\n如此高的預算，我們有可能在下一個熊市期間耗盡金庫中的大量ADA。\n\n預算委員會的成本似乎也很高。有些流程可以更具成本效益。我們真的需要預算峰會嗎？DReps可以在Cardano峰會上開會（見下文）。\n\n為IntersectMBO撥款2000萬ADA似乎很多。\n\n當我查看單個項目時，總額是270萬ADA。也許我理解錯了什麼。\n\n關於產品委員會類別，成本顯得很高，特別是對於我們可能不需要或我認為已經準備好的項目。\n\n如果我沒記錯的話，多資源共識Minotaur是為Midnight而不是Cardano構建的。Proof of Useful Work也是如此。\n\n我想主要關注可擴展性、ZK技術、L2s以及Cardano盡快需要的其他技術。預算中的一些項目可以等等。\n\n我希望看到一個與路線圖相關聯的預算。我們首先需要策略。然後制定路線圖並將其与預算聯繫起來。\n\n預算中最大的成本與Technical Steering Committee有關。核心維護將花費我們4000萬ADA。這似乎是一筆巨大的開支，值得更詳細地調查。\n\n在分配給Membership & Community Committee的8000萬ADA中，6000万ADA用於三個Catalyst基金。這給我們留下了2000萬ADA來討論。\n\n我從未聽說過Community Hubs。我知道有人提議在Catalyst中創建各種中心，有些也獲得了資助。我們真的需要為Community Hub投資320萬ADA嗎？\n\n1120万ADA分配給The Civic Committee。這包括委員會成員和DReps的報酬。\n\n180万ADA分配給DReps，約佔總預算的0.5%。雖然普遍的看法是DReps應該免費工作，但我認為使用預算的0.5%作為他們的獎勵是合理的。DReps和委員會成員應該得到一些補償。\n\nDReps決定預算。他們可以節省ADA或更好地指導預算。\n\n一個值得討論的話題是DReps是否應該更多地參與內部流程。DReps由社群選舉產生，如果他們有興趣，他們應該成為委員會成員並參與諸如編制預算之類的任務。\n\n也許只有那些更多參與這些流程的DReps才應該獲得報酬。\n\n我會將分配給Growth & Marketing Committee的2000萬ADA減半。Cardano需要投資於技術，而不是行銷。我或多或少同意增長部分的項目。\n\nCardano Summit 2026的成本是310萬ADA。我同意這一點，並將其直接與其他會議聯繫起來，例如DReps會議和關於下一個預算的辯論。\n\n我絕對不會付錢給網紅。我不相信這種行銷方式有效。\n\n我批准為Open Source Committee撥款380萬ADA，並且如果能在其他地方節省資金，我很樂意增加預算。\n\n儘管我對預算有所保留，並努力削減了一些成本，但我可能願意批准該預算。我還不確定。我希望看到一些變化。\n\n預算仍將根據社群的意見進行更改，因此請在Cardano Forum上發表評論。\n\n我的意見是，我們應該在行銷上節省開支，也許在Community Hubs上，在Cardano未來兩年不需要的技術開發上，以及其他項目上，而是應該鑄造穩定幣。\n\n每個人對預算都會有不同的看法。在去中心化的環境中很難達成共識。因此，除非我發現根本性問題，否則我傾向於批准預算。我將繼續審查預算並在需要時發表評論。\n\n我期待最終版本。",

          "originalText": "A few observations about the Cardano budget.\n\nI am pleased with the total budget of 266.7M ADA. I expect revenue to be higher (about 320M ADA), so we will likely save ADA for the next few years.\n\nBeing in a bull market, it is advantageous to invest more for several reasons. \n\nAs the market price of ADA increases, getting a higher dollar value with a smaller amount of ADA coins becomes possible. \n\nAdditionally, smart investments can attract new users to the ecosystem. Let's expect that user activity will decline in the middle of 2026. \n\nThe likely reason for allocating only 60M ADA to the next three Catalyst Funds (20M for each fund) is the higher market price of ADA.\n\nWhat I find missing in the budget are investments in DeFi and the minting of stablecoins. \n\nI envision minting 1-2M stablecoins each epoch, such as USDM and DJED. The cost would be around 140M USD, which translates to about 140M ADA if the average price of ADA throughout the bull market is 1 USD. \n\nHowever, if the average price of ADA were higher, say 2 USD, the cost in the ADA value would be half as much. The budget calculates that 1 ADA is 0.5 USD. That doesn't seem adequate to me.\n\nThis is a topic we should discuss and consider.\n\nCan the current budget be reduced? Can we allocate ADA differently?\n\nI don’t want to criticize the high costs line by line without knowing all the details. I’ll use common sense. \n\nFeel free to correct me or provide important context.\n\nOn-chain governance seems excessively expensive to me. While DReps can vote on governance actions, Intersect and various committees will cost us tens of millions of ADA. \n\nWith such a high budget, we risk depleting a significant amount of ADA in the treasury during the next bear market.\n\nThe costs of the Budget Committee also seem high. Some processes could be more cost-effective. Do we really need a Budget Summit? DReps can meet at the Cardano Summit (see below).\n\nAllocating 20M ADA for IntersectMBO seems like a lot. \n\nWhen I looked at the individual items, the total was 2.7M ADA. Perhaps I am misunderstanding something.\n\nRegarding the Product Committee category, the costs appear high, especially for items that we may not need or that I believe were already ready.\n\nIf I'm not mistaken, the multi-resource consensus Minotaur is being built for Midnight, not Cardano. The same applies to Proof of Useful Work.\n\nI would like to focus primarily on scalability, ZK technology, L2s, and other technologies that Cardano needs as soon as possible. Some items in the budget can wait.\n\nI would like to see a budget linked to the roadmap. We need the strategy first. Then make the roadmap and link it with the budget.\n\nThe largest costs in the budget relate to the Technical Steering Committee. Core Maintenance will cost us 40M ADA. This seems like a huge expense and is worth investigating in more detail.\n\nIn the 80M ADA allocated for the Membership & Community Committee, 60M ADA is for three Catalyst Funds. This leaves us with 20M ADA to discuss. \n\nI have never heard of Community Hubs. I know there were proposals to create various hubs in Catalyst, and some were funded. Do we really need to invest 3.2M ADA in the Community Hub?\n\n11.2M ADA is allocated for The Civic Committee. This includes compensation for committee members and DReps. \n\n1.8M ADA is allocated for DReps, which is roughly 0.5% of the total budget. While the prevailing opinion is that DReps should work for free, I believe using 0.5% of the budget for their rewards is reasonable. DReps and committee members deserve some compensation.\n\nDReps decide on the budget. They can save ADA or better direct the budget.\n\nA topic worth discussing is whether DReps should be more involved in internal processes. DReps are elected by the community, and if they are interested, they should be members of committees and participate in tasks like compiling the budget. \n\nPerhaps only those DReps who are more involved in these processes should be paid.\n\nI would halve the 20M ADA allocated for the Growth & Marketing Committee. Cardano needs to invest in technology, not marketing. I more or less agree with the items in the Growth section.\n\n3.1M ADA is the cost for Cardano Summit 2026. I would agree with that and link it directly to other meetings, such as the DReps meeting and the debate on the next budget.\n\nI would definitely not pay influencers. I don't believe this type of marketing works.\n\nI approve of 3.8M ADA for the Open Source Committee and would gladly increase the budget if possible, provided we save money elsewhere.\n\nDespite my reservations about the budget and my efforts to reduce some costs, I might be willing to approve the budget. I'm not sure yet. I would like to see some changes.\n\nThe budget will still change based on community input, so please comment on the Cardano Forum.\n\nMy opinion is that we should save on marketing, maybe on Community Hubs, development of technologies that Cardano does not need in the next 2 years, and other items and rather mint stablecoins.\n\nEveryone will have a different opinion on the budget. It will be difficult to find consensus in a decentralized environment. Therefore, I will tend to approve the budget unless I find a fundamental problem. I will continue to examine the budget and comment on it if needed.\n\nI am curious about the final version."

          "text": "關於「2025 Net Change Limit」治理資訊行動的提前投票意向公告：❌\n\n🚨如果您委託我投票，請重新委託給願意投贊成票或棄權票的人🚨\n\n我歡迎提議的Net Change Limit提案。提議者表示，從2024年1月5日（Epoch 459）到2024年12月30日（Epoch 531），Cardano財政部的實際總收入為335,957,093 ADA。\n\n提議的NCL為3.5億ADA。這比Cardano財政部2024年的總收入高出約1400萬ADA。我歡迎提案中提到的模型參考以及對我們已有數據的上一時期的參考。\n\n該動議使用上一年度ADA流入模型作為批准NCL的主要依據。這確實是必須考慮的因素之一。\n\n在這個提案中，我所缺失的是——因為它提出了一個相對較大的NCL——即便是對不同NCL的批准會如何影響ADA估值的初步經濟分析。3.5億ADA的NCL正在向市場發出一個訊號。這個訊號是什麼？\n\n它與以前的訊號相比如何？如果我們沒有數據，至少有預測的空間嗎？由於缺乏這種經濟/貨幣分析，我們只能進行猜測。我的感覺是，未來NCL的批准將成為決定ADA兌美元匯率的關鍵時刻。這是一個訊號，表明可以釋放多少ADA——一個由大多數DReps批准的訊號。\n\n大規模NCL的批准可能會對ADA的價值產生直接的價格影響，從而削弱3.5億ADA的購買力。在預算項目獲得批准之前。\n\n在批准大規模NCL之後，預算討論可能會在ADA/美元匯率較低的陰影下進行。因此，我們可能被迫將年度預算推向NCL的上限。我們可能會製造一個自我實現的預言。\n\n我認為第一年NCL過大的問題在於，我們的預算和治理流程在第一年是最薄弱和最低效的。我們審計、防止浪費和濫用的能力值得懷疑。較低的NCL會使人集中注意力。\n\n在沒有貨幣/經濟分析或預測的情況下，我會考慮在2025年投票支持2-2.5億ADA的NCL（取決於NCL提案的文本），因為這將向市場發出更好的訊號，表明我們打算平衡系統發展和維護ADA價值及Cardano前10名的地位。特別是，由於我們在去中心化治理初期管理如此巨額ADA支出的能力最低。\n\n我認為這種保守的方法能夠保護ADA持有者和質押者的利益。\n\n最佳實踐：我們應該批准最接近我們DReps實際期望預算的NCL。通過批准一個大得多的NCL，我們將在任何預算獲得批准以及承包商收到ADA之前使ADA貶值。這實際上是不必要地削弱了我們自己。\n\n如果像一些（許多？）DReps所表示的那樣，意圖是批准低於3.5億ADA的預算，那麼為了維護那些將獲得ADA的人的ADA價值，我們能做的最好的事情就是投票支持最接近2025年預期預算總額的NCL。",

          "originalText": "Early voting Intention announcement on: \"2025 Net Change Limit\" governance info action: ❌\n\n🚨If you are delegating to me, please redelegate to someone who wants to vote YES or ABSTAIN 🚨\n\nI welcome the proposed Net Change Limit proposal. The proposers have stated that from January 5th, 2024, Epoch 459, through December 30th, Epoch 531, the actual total income into the Cardano Treasury was 335,957,093 ada.\n\nThe proposed NCL is 350M ada. This is roughly 14M ada higher than the total income in the Cardano Treasury for 2024. I welcome the proposed reference to modelling and the reference to a previous period for which we have data. \n\nThe motion uses modelling of ADA inflow for the previous year as the main basis for approving an NCL. It is indeed one of the factors that must be considered.\n \nWhat I am missing in this proposal - as it proposes a relatively large NCL - is even a minor economic analysis of how approvals of different NCLs could impact the valuation of ADA. An NCL of 350M ADA is sending a signal to the market. What is this signal? \n\nHow does it compare to previous signals? If we do not have the data, is there room for a prediction at least?\nWith the lack of this economic/monetary analysis, we are left to speculate. My feeling is that NCL approvals in the future will become defining moments that shape the ADA exchange rate vs the USD. It is a signal how much ADA could be released - a signal approved by the majority of DReps. \n\nThe approval of a large NCL could have an immediate price impact on the value of ADA, thus diminishing the purchase power of the 350M ADA. Before the budget elements are approved. \n\nAfter approving a large NCL, the budgetary discussions will probably take place in the shadow of a lower ADA/USD exchange rate. Thus we might be forced by the market to push an annual budget towards the top limit of the NCL. We could create a self-fulfilling prophesy. \n\nThe problem I see with a very large first year NCL is that our budgetary and governance processes are the weakest and most inefficient in the first year. Our ability to audit, prevent waste and abuse are questionable. A lower NCL would focus minds.\n\nWithout a monetary/economic analysis or forecast, I would consider voting for a NCL in the 200-250M ADA in 2025 (depending on the text of the NCL proposal) as it would give a better signal to the market about our intentions to balance the development of the system and the intention to safeguard the value of ADA and Cardano's Top 10 position. Especially, as our abilities to manage the potential spending of so much ADA in the early days of decentralized governance are the lowest. \n\nI see this conservative approach as something that protects the interests of ADA holders and stakers. \n\nBest practice: We SHOULD approve the closest NCL to the actual budget that we want as DReps. By approving a much larger NCL we will be devaluing the ada currency BEFORE any budget is approved and before the contractors receive the ADA. Effectively crippling ourselves unnecessarily. \n\nIf the intention is to approve a lower budget than 350M ada as some (many?) DReps seem to have indicated, then to preserve the value of that ada for those who will receive it, the best thing we can do is to vote for an NCL that is closest to that intended 2025 budget total."

The UX is terrible for viewing multiple proposals, and there is no high level data aggregation which makes everything more difficult for DReps.\n\nTo help streamline things for all of us, I’ve made a budget spreadsheet with the data from the https://t.co/FPs8Wq7glV budget proposals here 👇\n\nhttps://t.co/kNdhf2u6w7\n\nFor some reason everyone can pick their rate of conversion for ADA to USD, which just makes a big mess of the numbers with variable conversion rates and has resulted in errors.\n\nI’ve flagged all proposals in red that have incorrect ADA to USD conversion rates, and have also created a balanced conversion rate for all proposals at the same rate that the @IntersectCBC  budget has been converted at ($0.50 USD).\n\nProviding everything in the currently submitted budget passes, we would still come under Net Change Limit if it is decided that this should be 350,000,000 ADA.\n\nWe are looking at 265,387,604 ADA from the Intersect budget, and 62,916,370 ADA from these new budget submissions.\n\nThis would put us at 328,303,974 $ADA , not including any new additions or any budget submissions by the CF or Emurgo.\n\nI personally want to spend significantly less than 350 Million ADA, so I will be voting no on the majority of these new proposals.\n\nI also think that the current Intersect budget still needs some cutting and further explaining, but this new budget process has been a great deflection to get eyes off of the existing @IntersectMBO budget 👀\n\nYou can see my full discussion on the Cardano 2025 budget here on the Cardano Forum:\n\nhttps://t.co/BvJNWbBvjf"

Intersect是否只會提交兩個預算資訊行動？\n4. 預算資訊行動何時提交？\n5. 為什麼第一次和解研討會長一天？\n\n在我看來，只計算參與投票的權益（即只計算投贊成票或反對票的DReps的投票權）的決定，門檻太低了，特別是因為投票階段只有兩天。\n\n所有治理行動中，不參與投票的權益表現得像投了反對票是有原因的。\n\n恕我直言，只考慮參與投票的權益，並且投票窗口如此之短，將使得提案過容易被納入。\n\n有些提案明天（4月24日）才會提交，所以沒有足夠的時間來審查它們。\n\n簡而言之：在如此短的投票期內僅考慮參與投票的權益是一個錯誤，這將降低預算資訊行動的合法性。",

Why was the decision made to only count the participating stake when calculating the approval threshold? Thereby deviating from the on-chain governance process.\n2. What happens if the approved proposals exceed the NCL?\n3. Will there only be two budget info actions submitted by Intersect?\n4. When will the budget info actions be submitted?\n5. Why is the first reconciliation Workshop 1 day longer?\n\nIn my opinion, the decision to count only participating stake, meaning only counting the voting power of DReps that vote yes or no, is too low of a threshold, especially since the voting phase is only two days.\n\nThere is a reason why non-participating stake behaves like a NO vote for all governance actions.\n\nIMHO only including participating stake and having a short voting window will make it too easy to be included. \n\nSome proposals will only be submitted tomorrow (April 24th), so there is not enough time to review them.\n\nTL;DR only considering participating stake with such a short voting period is a mistake that will decrease the legitimacy of the budget info actions"

I’ll keep this explanation straightforward, especially for those who may not be deeply involved yet in Cardano governance.\n\nWhat I Voted For\n\nI am supporting funding in the following strategic areas:\n\n- Zero Knowledge (ZK) Solutions (zkFold, ZK Bridge, Atlas PAB Hydra Integrations, etc.)\n\n- Cardano Node Development and Maintenance (Core Engineering, Rust Nodes, Maintenance Proposals)\n\n- Libraries and Developer Tooling (Pallas, MLabs Libraries, Extended Symbolic, Lucid, etc.)\n\n- Bitcoin Interoperability (Complete Web3 stack for Cardano-Bitcoin bridge)\n\n- Layer 2 Scaling Solutions (Midgard Rollups, Hydra integrations)\n\nReflections and Honest Assessment\n\nI want to be honest: I could not deeply analyze every single proposal.\n\nI focused primarily on:\n\n- Proposals from well-recognized teams in the ecosystem\n\n- Proposals I was directly asked to analyze\n\n- Proposals aligned with my beliefs of Cardano’s current priorities\n\nGiven the sheer volume (almost 200 proposals) and the limited time and support tools we currently have as DReps, this was an intense and imperfect process.\nIf you think I missed an important proposal, feel free to DM me — I’m happy to review it again.\n\nBudget Distribution Summary\n\n- CORE: 190,222,949 - 55.11%\n- Research: 29,598,000 - 8.57%\n- Gov-Support: 111,643,123 - 32.34%\n- Marketing: 94,623,933 - 27.41%\n- None: 766,800 - 0.22%\n\nTotal: 345,161,209 ADA\n\nWhy So Much Into Marketing?\n\nSome may ask why I supported significant marketing budgets.\n\nMy view is pragmatic:\n\nCardano is not a government, it's closer to a startup at this stage.\n\nIn a highly competitive crypto environment, growth is critical.\n\nAccumulating millions of ADA in treasury means little if we do not reinvest part of it in ecosystem expansion.\n\nI would support smaller marketing budgets in future rounds, but missing the 2025-2026 cycle would be a major strategic mistake.\n\nConclusion: Focus Areas for Next Year\n\nDReps must be compensated for the massive amount of work required. If not, simply DReps will not participate\n\nBetter tooling, AI support, and proposal management platforms are mandatory.\n\nCatalyst and Constitutional Governance must be better integrated, not siloed.\n\nThank you to everyone who submitted proposals, participated in discussions, and helped in this massive effort.

In line with my strategy, I mainly support the CORE category.\n\nThe second largest category I support is MARKETING & INNOVATION, which includes Catalyst and Cardano Summit.\n\nThis time, I chose not to support any proposals from Intersect, which was intended to assist DReps. The process, however, has been chaotic, far beyond my expectations. The NCL was approved in April, and the Budget likely won’t be finalized until May or later.\n\nThe tipping point was giving DReps just a few days to vote using a new, untested tool over a weekend.

          "text": "我投票反對 ⛔️ 將Net Change Limit (NCL) 降至2億ADA，這是迄今為止最艱難的治理決策之一。\n\n感覺這裡沒有完全好的選擇。\n\n而且，我自己也曾呼籲降低NCL。\n\n目前3.5億ADA的NCL存在一些明顯的缺點。\n\n如果巨大的拋售壓力導致ADA價格大幅下跌，比如跌至0.2美元，可能會導致嚴重的挑戰。\n\n以美元計價為生態系統提供資金將需要從國庫中出售大量ADA，從而導致拋售壓力的螺旋式上升，使情況進一步惡化。\n\nCardano Whale (@cardano_whale) 指出，像Tezos和Polkadot這樣的一些項目在其生態系統中投入了大量資金，擁有創新技術，但仍難以獲得實質性的關注。\n\n我完全同意這一點。\n\n對於區塊鏈而言，保持在前十大市值排名中至關重要。\n\n散戶投資者、機構和加密貨幣愛好者不僅根據技術，還根據市場表現來評估項目。\n\n如果Cardano長期跌出前十名，無論其去中心化程度或像Ouroboros Leios這樣的技術進步如何，它可能永遠無法重回 прежнее положение。\n\n這是一個需要考慮的重要因素，即使感覺不公平或主觀。\n\n另一方面，將NCL降至2億ADA也存在其自身的擔憂。\n\nCardano需要投資來推進其技術，支持建設者並發展生態系統。如果沒有增加的用戶活動，國庫收入將無法增長。\n\n未來幾年在維護和開發上的支出可能會耗盡儲備，最終使Cardano在經濟上不可持續。\n\n協議安全性也取決於有吸引力的質押獎勵和激勵措施。此外，如果沒有活躍的開發者、工具和不斷發展的DeFi生態系統，Ouroboros Leios的潛力將無法發揮。所有這些領域的投資都至關重要。\n\nIOG已經明確了他們的資金需求：Core Dev需要9600萬ADA，Catalyst需要6900万ADA，Research需要2700万ADA。總計1.92億ADA。IOG的提議很簡單：要麼批准這筆資金，要麼就算了。\n\n關於公平性、IOG和Charles過去的貢獻以及Cardano「完成」定義的辯論自有其道理，但現實是IOG在協議方面擁有無與倫比的專業知識。沒有任何其他實體能夠以相同的速度或品質有效地接管維護、開發和研究。\n\n如果DReps將1.92億ADA分配給IOG，那麼其他項目只剩下800萬ADA。\n\n在審查了預算提案後，我只支持了我認為生態系統絕對需要的基本項目：像Midgard、Starstream、Hydra、ZK Rollups、Blockfrost、Lucid、Chainlink整合等項目。\n\n僅CORE類別一項，就大約需要1200萬ADA。所有類別的總批准預算達到2.13億ADA。\n\n鑒於我自己估計所需支出為2.13億ADA，我無法支持2億ADA的NCL。\n\n這將與我對必要項目資金的立場與我批准的上限相矛盾。這種不一致性導致我決定投票反對降低NCL。\n\nCardano需要有效的行銷和改進的治理支持，因為目前的情況遠非理想。\n\n投資生態系統和推進新技術必須齊頭並進，以確保持續增長。\n\n在我看來，批准2億ADA的NCL意味著維持現狀，將所有關鍵職責留給IOG，同時忽視對更廣泛生態系統的投資。\n\n從本質上講，這將限制對那些對生態系統至關重要的實體的資助，就像IOG一樣。\n\n一個重要的考量因素是圍繞NCL的預期情景。\n\n在我看來，3.5億ADA和2億ADA這兩個NCL都是極端的。\n\n目前的NCL設定為3.5億ADA，得到了76%參與投票權益的強力支持。幾乎所有投票權益都批准了它。將NCL從3.5億ADA大幅削減至2億ADA，要麼是不負責任，要麼是過於雄心勃勃。\n\n接下來會發生什麼？建設者、Intersect、IOG或其他方面可能會提交一項新的治理行動，提議一個中間的NCL，也許是2.5億或3億ADA。或者，可能會同時提交多個提案。\n\n這種情況將造成一個不穩定、適得其反且難以支持的環境。這種不穩定會破壞進展。\n\n此外，加密社群對Cardano生態系統能夠負擔多少投資的長時間辯論興趣不大。\n\n在不穩定的環境中，即使提出一個連貫的預算也幾乎是不可能的。\n\n目前，我們的NCL為3.5億ADA。考慮一下這種可能的情景：\n\nIntersect預計將提交一項於6月份到期的預算治理行動。與此同時，如果到5月底批准了2億ADA的新NCL，那麼擬議的預算實際上將變得違憲，除非在新NCL生效前獲得批准。\n\n這使得流程複雜化，並進一步凸顯了突然、極端變化帶來的問題。\n\n通過治理行動來辯論NCL既效率低下又過於耗時。\n\n社群的共識似乎很可能在2.5億至3億ADA之間。然而，在鏈上投票之前沒有進行任何鏈下意向調查（大多數社群成員會對此做出回應），這導致目前的NCL僅僅是為了讓預算流程得以繼續而被批准。\n\nNCL的概念本身開始讓人覺得沒有必要，因為它總是隨著多數票的變化而變化。如果投票權益同意增加或減少NCL，這必然會發生。\n\n重要的是要強調，NCL並不決定必須從國庫中支出的金額。每一項提款提案仍需社群批准。\n\n如果目前的提案在2.5億至3億ADA的範圍內，我可能會投贊成票。如果提交了這樣的提案，我會支持它，因為它符合我認為基於我所認可的提案的合理預算。\n\n然而，我的決定並非最終決定，可能會根據治理的未來發展而改變。\n\n例如，如果治理行動將多個提案合併導致總成本過高，或者如果IOG提案與我不支持的幾個提案或我強烈反對的一個提案（例如Daedalus 2025服務增強提案）捆綁在一起，我可能會重新考慮我的立場。\n\n如果阻止糟糕預算結果的唯一方法是投票支持較低的NCL，我準備這樣做。這個決定是微妙的，不能簡單地以非黑即白的方式看待。\n\n我希望避免出現批准較低NCL後不可避免地導致另一次GA提交的情況。反覆處理NCL既耗時又沒有成效。\n\nDReps需要優先處理預算提案。\n\n如果一個較高的NCL最終資助了預算中低質量的項目，那麼它就毫無意義。\n\n我的DRep ID：\ndrep1km69g7ksf8t5g0h9d9tkrcd2tezxelx0wtr76rv2mrkl5nzd6v3",

          "originalText": "I voted NO ⛔️to reduce the Net Change Limit (NCL) to 200M ADA, which has been one of the toughest governance decisions so far. \n\nIt feels like there’s no entirely good option here.\n\nMoreover, I myself called for a lower NCL.\n\nThe current NCL of 350M ADA has some notable drawbacks.\n\nIf high selling pressure causes ADA’s price to drop significantly, say to 0.2 USD, it could result in serious challenges. \n\nFunding the ecosystem in dollar terms would require selling a large amount of ADA from the treasury, leading to a spiral of selling pressure that could worsen the situation.\n\nCardano Whale (@cardano_whale) pointed out that some projects like Tezos and Polkadot have invested heavily in their ecosystems, possess innovative technologies, yet struggle to gain substantial attention.\n\nI fully agree with that.\n\nFor blockchains, maintaining a presence in the top 10 market capitalization rankings is vital.\n\nRetail investors, institutions, and crypto enthusiasts evaluate projects not only based on technology but also on market performance. \n\nIf Cardano drops out of the top 10 for an extended period, it may never regain its position, regardless of decentralization or technological progress like Ouroboros Leios. \n\nThis is an important factor to consider, even if it feels unfair or subjective.\n\nOn the other hand, reducing the NCL to 200M ADA comes with its own set of concerns.\n\nCardano needs investments to advance its technology, support builders, and develop the ecosystem. Without increased user activity, Treasury revenue won't grow. \n\nSpending on maintenance and development in the next years risks exhausting the reserve, ultimately making Cardano economically unsustainable.\n\nProtocol security also hinges on attractive staking rewards and incentives. Moreover, Ouroboros Leios’s potential will remain untapped without active developers, tools, and a growing DeFi ecosystem. Investments in all these areas are crucial.\n\nIOG has made their funding requirements clear: Core Dev needs 96M ADA, Catalyst 69M ADA, and Research 27M ADA. Combined, this totals 192M ADA. The offer from IOG is simple: either approve this funding or let it be.\n\nDebates around fairness, IOG and Charles’s past contributions, and the definition of “completion” for Cardano have their place, but the reality is that IOG holds unmatched expertise in the protocol. No other entity can effectively take over maintenance, development, and research at the same pace or quality.\n\nIf DReps allocate 192M ADA to IOG, only 8M ADA remains for other projects.\n\nAfter reviewing budget proposals, I supported only the essentials I believe the ecosystem absolutely needs: projects like Midgard, Starstream, Hydra, ZK Rollups, Blockfrost, Lucid, Chainlink integration, and others. \n\nFor the CORE category alone, this amounts to around 12M ADA. Across all categories, my total approved budget comes to 213M ADA.\n\nGiven my own estimate of required expenditures is 213M ADA, I cannot support an NCL of 200M ADA. \n\nIt would contradict my stance on necessary project funding versus the cap I approve. This inconsistency guided my decision to vote NO on reducing the NCL.\n\nCardano requires effective marketing and improved governance support, as the current situation is far from ideal.\n\nInvesting in the ecosystem and advancing new technologies must go hand in hand to ensure sustainable growth.\n\nApproving the NCL of 200M ADA, in my view, would mean preserving the status quo, leaving all key responsibilities to IOG while neglecting investment in the broader ecosystem. \n\nEssentially, it would restrict funding for entities that are vital to the ecosystem, just as IOG is.\n\nAn important consideration is the expected scenarios surrounding the NCL.\n\nBoth NCLs, an NCL of 350M ADA and 200M ADA, are extremes in my view.\n\nThe current NCL, set at 350M ADA, has strong support with 76% of the voting stake participating. Nearly the entire voting stake approved it. Drastically reducing the NCL from 350M to 200M ADA would be either irresponsible or overly ambitious.\n\nWhat would happen next? Builders, Intersect, IOG, or others would likely submit a new governance action proposing an intermediate NCL, perhaps 250M or 300M ADA. Alternatively, multiple proposals could be submitted simultaneously.\n\nThis scenario would create an unstable environment that is counterproductive and difficult to support. Such instability undermines progress.\n\nMoreover, the crypto community has little interest in prolonged debates about how much the Cardano ecosystem can afford to invest.\n\nIn an unstable environment, even proposing a coherent budget becomes nearly impossible.\n\nCurrently, we have an NCL of 350M ADA. Consider this likely scenario:\n\nIntersect is expected to submit a governance action for the budget expiring in June. Meanwhile, if a new NCL of 200M ADA is approved by the end of May, the proposed budget would effectively become unconstitutional unless it is approved before the new NCL takes effect. \n\nThis complicates the process and further highlights the issues with sudden, extreme changes.\n\nDebating the NCL through governance actions is both inefficient and overly time-consuming.\n\nIt seems likely that the community's consensus would fall somewhere between 250M–300M ADA. However, no off-chain temperature check was conducted (to which the majority of the community would respond) before the on-chain vote, which led to the current NCL being approved simply to allow the budgeting process to continue.\n\nThe concept of the NCL itself is starting to feel unnecessary, as it constantly shifts based on the majority vote. If the voting stake agrees to increase or decrease the NCL, it will inevitably happen.\n\nIt’s important to emphasize that the NCL doesn’t dictate the amount that must be spent from the treasury. Every withdrawal proposal still requires approval from the community.\n\nI would likely vote YES if the current proposal fell within the 250M–300M ADA range. If a proposal like this is submitted, I would support it, as it aligns with the budget I consider reasonable based on the proposals I have endorsed.\n\nHowever, my decision isn’t final and may change depending on future developments in governance. \n\nFor instance, if governance actions combine multiple proposals that result in an excessively high total cost, or if the IOG proposal is grouped with several proposals I don’t support, or one I strongly oppose, such as the Daedalus 2025 Service Enhancement, I might reconsider my stance.\n\nIf the only way to prevent a poor budget outcome is to vote for a lower NCL, I am prepared to do so. This decision is nuanced and cannot be seen in black-and-white terms.\n\nI want to avoid a scenario where approving a lower NCL inevitably results in another GA submission. Addressing the NCL repeatedly is time-consuming and unproductive. \n\nDReps need to prioritize budget proposals instead.\n\nA higher NCL serves no purpose if it ends up funding low-quality projects within the budget.\n\nMy DRep ID:\ndrep1km69g7ksf8t5g0h9d9tkrcd2tezxelx0wtr76rv2mrkl5nzd6v3"

          "text": "是時候回報我最近的投票了！長文如下 👇\n\n從NCL開始，我投票贊成更大的3.5億上限。主要理由是資金延遲可能對Cardano上的許多小型專案造成不利影響。沒有NCL，國庫無法提款，所以我們需要設立一個。現在這個問題解決了，我正在考慮將上限降至2億是否合理。目前，我傾向於不這樣做，因為我相信我們正處於生態系統的關鍵時刻，必須積極投入資源以彌補我們落後的領域。\n\n關於預算項目，我的流程如下。由於時間有限，我優先考慮了a) 對預算影響較大的較昂貴項目和b) 我具有一定專業知識的較技術性項目。我的預設選項是「棄權」，用於我認為無法就為何應接受或拒絕提案提供充分見解的情況。我顯然對@zkFold的提案存在偏見，但我試圖根據每個提案自身的價值來考慮，而不是它將如何使我們公司受益（如下所示）。我還非常關注成本。我相信（幾乎？）沒有不可替代的供應商，因此在產出和成本方面總有談判的餘地。以下所有內容都是我作為DRep的個人觀點。我投票表決的值得注意的項目：\n\n- @InputOutputHK的研究提案是最容易投票的提案之一。我們絕對應該推進這些研究項目，因為它們為我們的生態系統提供了超越競爭對手的優勢。而且考慮到所有因素，價格標籤是適中的。\n\n- 接下來，我還投票贊成了@InputOutputHK的開發提案。大多數項目對我來說都很有意義，儘管成本很高。這是一件小事，但我確實希望Babel fees項目不僅僅是這樣宣傳的，而是實際上是一個部分平衡交易的綜合解決方案。Babel fees正由不同的生態系統參與者獨立實施，包括@FluidTokens和@zkFold。它們本身並不需要硬分叉。而這個單一項目（Babel fees）的預算就超過了@zkFold的年度預算。\n\n- 然後，我投票支持了@zkFold的提案以及@AnastasiaLabs的Midgard和@SebastienGllmt的Starstream。我認為所有這些技術與其價格相比都能產生巨大的影響。是的，它們之間存在一些重疊，但我們不知道事情會如何發展，所以進行許多具有100倍潛力的小額押注對我來說最有意義。\n\n- 我有些猶豫地投票支持了Project Catalyst預算。一方面，路線圖看起來非常有前景。我確實喜歡提案中寫的內容。另一方面，成本非常高，而且在我看來，Project Catalyst為提案者提供的體驗一直在下降。鑒於Cardano治理自早期基金以來已經成熟，我們可以減少官僚作風和開銷，而不是增加！生態系統現在可以更有效地篩選不良提案，而無需Catalyst團隊的指導。而當需要Catalyst團隊的調解時，卻又缺乏。但總而言之，Catalyst對生態系統非常有益。\n\n- 我對Tweag提案投了「反對」票，因為其他DReps的擔憂尚未得到妥善解決，而且TSC的審查又增加了更多問題（法國每個開發人員30萬以上，真的嗎？）。\n\n- 我對Intersect提案投了「反對」票。TSC周圍的情況令人擔憂，在我看來，這凸顯了該組織極端的中心化程度。該提案要求巨額資金，而支出項目卻含糊不清。我們正在創建一些無法自行做出任何決定、充當董事會高薪分析師的委員會。至少在我看來是這樣。樂於被糾正。\n\n- 最後，我投票贊成了@TxPipe的提案，因為過去他們生產了出色的產品，為眾多Cardano項目降低了開發成本。此外，這些工具不易變現，因此生態系統應該支持它們。",

          "originalText": "It’s time to report on my recent votes! Long read below 👇\n\nStarting with the NCL, I voted in favor of a larger 350m limit. The main reasoning was that a delay in funding could be detrimental for many smaller projects on Cardano. Without the NCL, treasury withdrawals cannot be done, so we needed to set up one. Now that this problem is solved, I am considering whether it makes sense to lower the limit to 200m. Currently, leaning no on this one as I believe we are at a critical moment for the ecosystem and have to spend resources aggressively to catch up in the areas where we are lagging.\n\nRegarding the budget items, my process was as follows. Having limited time, I prioritized a) more expensive items that have a bigger impact on the budget and b) more technical items where I have some expertise. My default was the “abstain” option, which I used in situations where I felt I could not offer a good insight on why the proposal should be accepted or rejected. I am obviously biased about @zkFold’s proposals, but I tried to consider every proposal on its own merit and not how it would benefit us as a company (as you can see below). I also paid a lot of attention to the costs. I believe there’s (almost?) no irreplaceable vendors, and so there’s always room for negotiation with regards to outputs and cost. Everything below is my personal opinion as a DRep. Notable items that I voted on:\n\n- @InputOutputHK's research proposal was one of the easiest votes. We should definitely advance in those research items as they provide our ecosystem with an edge over the competition. And the price tag is moderate, all things considered.\n\n- Next, I also voted in favor of the @InputOutputHK's development proposal. Most of the items make total sense to me, although the cost is high. It is a minor thing, but I do hope the Babel fees project is just marketed as such, but is actually a comprehensive solution for partially balanced transactions. Babel fees are being implemented independently by different ecosystem players, including @FluidTokens and @zkFold. They do not require a hardfork, per se. And the budget for this single item (babel fees) is more than @zkFold's yearly budget.\n\n- Then, I voted for @zkFold’s proposals as well as @AnastasiaLabs's Midgard and @SebastienGllmt's Starstream. I think all these technologies can have a huge impact compared to their price. Yes, there is some overlap between those, but we don’t know how things play out, so making many small bets with 100x potential makes the most sense to me.\n\n- With some hesitation, I voted for the Project Catalyst budget. On the one hand, the roadmap looks really promising. I do like what is written in the proposal. On the other hand, the cost is very high, and the Project Catalyst experience for proposers has been degrading, in my opinion. Given that the Cardano governance has matured since early funds, we can afford to have less bureaucracy and overhead, not more! The ecosystem can now filter bad proposals much more efficiently without Catalyst’s team handholding. And when the Catalyst’s team mediation is needed, it is lacking. All in all, though, Catalyst has been highly beneficial for the ecosystem.\n\n- I voted “no” on the Tweag proposal as the concerns of other DReps have not been properly cleared, and the TSC review added more on top (300k+ per developer in France, really?).\n\n- I voted “no” on the Intersect proposal. The situation around TSC is concerning, and, in my opinion, it highlights the extreme degree of centralization in the organization. The proposal asks for a huge sum, while the expense items are vague. We are creating committees that cannot make any decisions on their own and serve as very expensive analysts for the board. At least, that’s how it looks to me. Happy to be corrected.\n\n- Finally, I voted in favor of @TxPipe’s proposals as, in the past, they’ve produced great products that reduced development costs for numerous Cardano projects. Plus, it is not easy to monetize those tools, so the ecosystem should support them."

Its hared to say but I trust my experience in tendering successful startup products in the UK and the US.\n\n2. Intersect have made significant changes in the past 2 weeks for the sole reason to gain community support. Lawrence leaving and Jack taking place is sentiment to Intersects commitment, and talking with Jack on recent budget conversations and spaces he has better ideas (to be clear here I very much respect Lawerence and his way of thinking, and view this change as cosmetic vs necessary, but I see the replacements building upon his work and directly answering community concerns)\n\n3. I am open to alternatives, but I do not have one myself to date, and I am yet to see a DRep who has voted no, provide an alternative? \n\nKeep it real, be authentic and give me your real views DReps!"

Nearly 200 proposals were bundled into one to simplify voting and support core operations across the ecosystem.\n\nThe process has been messy. There has been confusion, frustration, and legitimate concerns. Still, Intersect pulled this proposal together and put it forward for a vote.\n\nNow people want to vote for the proposals inside but not fund Intersect itself. That leaves the proposals orphaned with an administrator with no funds.\nIt's like approving the orphanage but abandoning the staff.\n\nWithout Intersect, the whole proposal falls apart.

But one week into my new interim role, we had to make a difficult call.\n\nIn this position, even temporarily, I need to be able to stand behind a plan I can defend, one that reflects what Intersect can and should be doing for Cardano over the next 12 months.\n\nThe feedback from the community was clear and important. We moved quickly to revise the proposal: we reduced the overall ask, refined the scope, and committed to returning any surplus funds to the Treasury.\n\nMore importantly, this decision was shaped by our role in the ecosystem. Intersect is the only available Administrator in this budget cycle. For better or worse, that’s the current reality. It’s not ideal, but it does mean we carry a constitutional responsibility to help unlock Treasury funding and kickstart ecosystem priorities. We felt that responsibility had to be met with urgency and accountability.\n\nWe hope these revisions are good enough for the community and DReps to support us for another 12 months. And if they’re not, we’ll keep listening and improving.\n\nI’m here and open to radical accountability. That is part of what this role demands. Thanks to everyone pushing us to be better.\n\nhttps://t.co/Y2mwhyx0ss"

          "originalText": "I encourage all DReps to vote \"YES\" to fund @IntersectMBO for 2025-2026. \n\nInteresect's funding proposal: https://t.co/eNrxNfASyK\n\n---\n\nAdditional Notes: \n\nI am a member of the Intersect's Cardano Budget Committee (@IntersectCBC). I joined in order to build a process for builders, developers, and marketers to apply for and receive funding from the Treasury via DRep approval. Developing this process has been difficult at times, but I believe that Intersect is on the right track, and it is in our interest as a Community to fund and further develop this Institution. At present, this is our best vehicle for involving the broader @Cardano community in on-chain governance.\n\n- (1) Intersect will serve as Administrator for Treasury-funded contracts - All proposals that have received a \"YES\" vote from the DReps need an Administrator. To my knowledge, no other organization has stepped forward to act as an Administrator for these proposals. Intersect can serve in this vital role. \n\n- (2) Intersect does not have sole control over Treasury fund disbursement - Intersect will work within a set of multiple key holders to administer the smart contract that releases funds to the teams. They will not unilaterally withhold or release funds. This set of key holders will represent the builders in the Cardano community. \n  \n- (3) Processes and performance - We should judge this organization based on its failures but its successes. While imperfect, Intersect has helped pass a Cardano net change limit and has arrived at a Budget Reconciliation process with Ekklesia.  The Cardano Annual Budget process is now working. In 2022-2024, in conjunction with IOG, Intersect successfully coordinated a global conversation around the governance guardrail CIP-1694 and the first Constitution for Cardano. This was also a hugely successful effort. Let's not lose sight of the forest for the trees: Intersect is functioning. \n  \n- (4) Leadership and community involvement - Jack Briggs (@JBriggsLondon) is leading the work at Intersect with Nick Cook (@NC_IntersectMBO), and I believe in their leadership. I also personally know many of the team members at Intersect, and I vouch for their efficacy and diligence in their work. These team members are on the ground at events, they are participating online in discussion, and they are accessible to the community. Additionally, we have just seen community members newly elected to all Intersect committees. I believe that these leaders will steer Intersect to an even better state.\n  \n- (5) Time limit - This funding will be only for one year. If we find that Intersect does not do its job or meaningfully advance the interests of the Cardano community through its efforts, I will not call for support for this organization again.\n\n- (6) Demonstrated willingness to listen and to change - This organization has listened to community feedback and has revised its approach multiple times. It is sensitive to the will of the Cardano community and will continue to iterate until they get things right. In my mind, this is the essence of the Age of Voltaire. Nobody gave us a playbook as a Community, and folks took a chance to work at a new organization and adapt as quickly as possible while enduring intense, deserved scrutiny. I believe this willingness to listen and adapt gives them the mandate to lead."

Administrators啟用Treasury提款——只有包含administrator的已批准預算才允許treasury提款。因此，Intersect（或DReps可接受的、擔任administrator的其他實體）對於實施任何社群批准的資金至關重要，以確保預算的合法性和合規性。\n→ Constitution參考：第四條，第二節和第三節；Guardrails TREASURY-01a至TREASURY-04a\n\n4.

Intersect（或DReps可接受的、擔任administrator的其他實體）維持Governance Infrastructure——Constitution期望社群維持鏈下治理流程。作為MBO，Intersect支持包括工具、流程管理和Constitutional Committee運營需求在內的基本基礎設施。如果Intersect不復存在，則必須有另一個實體來承擔這一角色。\n→ Constitution參考：第三條，第六節；第七條，第七節和第八節\n\n6. 沒有Administrator會危及整個Governance Model——Intersect（或其他administrator）的行政職能是Cardano治理的基礎和強制性組成部分。沒有獲得資助的administrator，任何基於treasury的治理行動都無法進行，這會削弱DReps的決策，並威脅去中心化治理的連續性。\n→ Constitution參考：第四條，第二至五節；第七條，第四節",

Without Intersect acting as administrator (or the emergence of a different administrator acceptable to DReps) no budget can fulfill this requirement.\n→ Constitution Reference: Article IV, Section 2\n\n2. No Administrator means no budget—and No Governance Execution--\nTreasury withdrawals cannot occur unless they are part of an approved budget and under the supervision of a designated administrator. Without funding for Intersect (or the emergence of a different administrator acceptable to DReps) there is no administrator—effectively halting the execution of any governance action involving treasury funds.\n→ Constitution Reference: Article IV, Sections 2 & 3; Guardrails TREASURY-04a\n\n3. Administrators Enable Treasury Withdrawals--\nOnly an approved budget that includes an administrator allows treasury withdrawals. Intersect (or a different entity acceptable to DReps, acting as the administrator) is thus essential to implement any community-approved funding, ensuring the budget's legitimacy and compliance.\n→ Constitution Reference: Article IV, Sections 2 & 3; Guardrails TREASURY-01a to TREASURY-04a\n\n4. Intersect (or  a different entity acceptable to DReps) acting as the administrator, ensures Budget Oversight, Transparency, and Audits--\nThe Constitution requires that all treasury withdrawals include allocations for independent audits and oversight metrics. Intersect (or  a different entity acceptable to DReps, acting as the administrator) fulfills this role by managing separate, auditable accounts and implementing governance-related dispute resolution.\n→ Constitution Reference: Article IV, Section 4 & 5\n\n5. Intersect (or a different entity acceptable to DReps, acting as the administrator) sustains Governance Infrastructure--\nThe Constitution expects the community to maintain off-chain governance processes. Intersect, as an MBO, supports essential infrastructure including tooling, process administration, and the Constitutional Committee’s operational needs. Another entity would have to step up to take on this role if Intersect ceases to exist.\n→ Constitution Reference: Article III, Section 6; Article VII, Sections 7 & 8\n\n6. No Administrator Risks the Entire Governance Model-\nIntersect’s (or a different  administrator's) administrative function is foundational and mandatory to Cardano’s governance. Without a funded administrator, no treasury-based governance actions can proceed, undermining DReps’ decisions and threatening the continuity of decentralized governance.\n→ Constitution Reference: Article IV, Sections 2–5; Article VII, Section 4"

          "originalText": "DReps have the absolute right to reject Intersect's budget proposal.  That's amazing democracy in action!  What would happen next is that one or more alternative administrators would have to emerge and get funding.  All previously approved budgets that had designated Intersect as their administrator would have to be resubmitted and new votes would have to take place.  The new administrator or administrators identified in resubmitted budget proposals would have to also separately submit their own budget proposals for funding.  Going this direction is the right of the Cardano Community.  Of course it would likely result in a delay of any treasury withdrawals by at least 3 to 6 months, potentially creating a risk for the ongoing operation of Cardano.  Again, however, this is for the Cardano community to decide.  Challenging problems indeed but so wonderful to see our DReps engaging in such important debates and considerations."

          "text": "🔥 時機已到 🔥 我已在Ekklesia上完成了對Intersect Budget的投票。\n\n我的主要投票基於潛在的2億 $ADA NCL\n\n這意味著核心必需品得到資助，所剩無幾。\n\n我的主要支持用於資助@InputOutputHK和@Catalyst_onX\n\n然而，我個人的NCL是2.5億ADA，這為#Cardano所需的資金留下了更多空間\n\n如果有人提交2.5億的NCL，我也會投票支持你 👀\n\n我的總支出為247,316,767 ADA\n\n我的完整投票歷史：\nhttps://t.co/JvcruoAc5x\n\n我的Budget Breakdown：\nhttps://t.co/5NvbG8I4k5\n\n我的DRep ID：\ndrep1ytxr0lhg5j72wysva9ac2gsn4lck4gyen8ywxkqfchsqg3qs8uy44\n\n我的其他首選是：\n\n✅Starstream: @PaimaStudios的下一代VM\n✅Cardano Ecosystem Pavilions at Exhibitions by @invalid_eutxo @DiscoverCardano\n✅透過Cardano Smart Contracts解鎖BTC流動性\n+\n✅Open-Source Composable Smart Contracts Audit Funding by Danogo @danogo_2023\n✅Hardware Wallets Maintenance by @vacuumlabs\n\n最後一個符合2億NCL的提案是：\n\n✅MLabs Core Tool Maintenance & Enhancement: Cardano.nix by @MLabs10\n\n對於2.5億ADA的NCL，我認為最需要關注的提案和方面是：\n\n關鍵基礎設施+維護成本：\n\n有太多符合此類別的資金申請。Midgard、#Bitcoin整合和Zk Rollups是首要考量的，但主要供應商包括：\n\n@MLabs10 @tweagio @txpipe_tools @zkFold @AnastasiaLabs @GeniusyieldO @DripDropz_io @cexplorer_io @ada_stat @eternlwallet @nftcdn_io @adahandle\n\nOSC Budget Proposal - Paid Open Source Model for Sustainable Development也應獲得資助。\n\n關鍵Governance Support：\n\n1⃣ Cardano Constitutional Committee Formation and Governance Training with the SanchoNet Education Network by @Hornan7\n\n這是繼續未來鏈上治理的必要條件。\n\n2⃣ Quality Assurance: On-Chain & Off-Chain Audit by @jrv97_velazquez\n\n我們需要一個獨立的資金分配審計流程，這是迄今為止最好的提案。\n\n社群行銷，而非CF或Emurgo：\n\n1⃣Cardano Ecosystem Pavilions at Exhibitions\n2⃣Amplify Cardano: Community-Led Events Fund by Rare Network @RareEvo\n3⃣Amplify Cardano: Community-Led Marketing Fund by Rare Network\n4⃣Cardano Rising: Japan Delegation to Rare Evo for Media and Enterprise Impact by Lightning Communications\n5⃣Cardano Japan Renaissance by Pacific Meta Inc.\n\nCF @Cardano_CF的行銷：\n\n✅Cardano Summit 2025 and regional tech events\n\nCF有多個行銷提案，但這是我唯一認為他們最能勝任的。\n\n他們的要求也很高，我相信他們應該為其行銷工作（如Cardano峰會）獲得部分補償，但不是全部。\n\nCF擁有genesis ADA，他們應該將其用於改善Cardano社群。\n\n❌ Emurgo @emurgo_io 沒有任何提案\n\n他們擁有大量genesis ADA，作為Cardano的商業分支，他們應該用這些資金來資助行銷和商業活動。\n\n相反，他們正在使用genesis ADA來否決實際Cardano社群成員提出的競爭性行銷提案。\n\nEmurgo / @YoroiWallet 在使用genesis ADA和錢包授權方面存在嚴重的利益衝突，以謀取自身利益。\n\n我不會支持這種公然濫用我們治理體系和treasury資金的行為。\n\nIntersect @IntersectMBO 也沒有說服我他們應該獲得1500萬ADA的營運成本，所以他們也得到了否決票。\n\n總的來說，我感謝大家為此所做的所有工作。\n\n如果我對你的提案投了反對票，很可能是由於成本限制，該提案更適合Catalyst，或者沒有提供足夠的資訊來證明投贊成票是合理的。\n\n我為一些提案留下了回饋，但由於時間限制，並非所有提案都有。\n\n非常感謝@adamKDean和@MadOrkestra創造了Ekklesia 🔥\n\n還要非常感謝所有使我們走到這一步的志工和社群成員，以及所有真正關心並做出貢獻的DReps。\n\n非常感謝！❤️",

Work that itself in some cases comes with such a hefty price tag that the on-chain governance process and DRep set should be allowed to directly engage with it before approving. \n\nIn prior votes I have at length explained why we cannot be too excessive with treasury disbursements. High level: \n\nWe’re tinkering with monetary policy, it is a mistake to view the treasury through a fiscal or even budgetary lens. \n\nCrypto is about disinflation, Bitcoin is sub 1% now (putting everyone under pressure, 2025 is not 2020) while Cardano is sub 2%. Treasury spending introduces new inflation at a time other protocols like BNB and Tron have manually had to burn double digits of supply to stay around the top 10. \n\nIf this spending comes along with adoption or big imminent improvements to Cardano it may be worth it, but it can’t be haphazard and it makes sense to start cautiously. I consider this Intersect budget proposal to be haphazard, and want to flag my discontent with the entire process. \n\nVoting should have been done on-chain from day 1, scrutinised by the full DRep set and with appropriate spam filters applied. Maybe at most bucketing several smaller cost effective and highly related proposals like we saw with Midgard and Starstream.\n\nBut also, even if we were to see this exercise as a sort of fiscal budgeting, budgeting is not about finding out how many items have a critical mass of people who would like to spend on them. It’s about combining those preferences with a set of considerations that include first understanding how much we CAN spend first, and then being SELECTIVE about it. \n\nThe worry I and many others have had, that the NCL becomes the target instead of a constraint, is now turning out to be valid. I don’t think the market in 2025-26 has the appetite to stomach 350m ADA in emissions, or even 275m. \n\nI have lodged complaints about the process here before and have signalled multiple times I would not be able to support such a budget. I will once again reiterate that this spending path we are on is the single biggest risk to Cardano currently. I worry."

          "text": "🚫我對由Intersect管理的2.75億ADA的Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Budget投了反對票。\n\n理由：\n\n我強烈反對將所有提案捆綁成一個方案供DReps批准。\n\n關鍵提案與不太重要或不必要的提案（其中許多屬於Catalyst）混雜在一起。\n\n預算責任要求對個別提案或較小的方案組做出決策，而不是一個大型方案。\n\n提案細分：\n\n• 在Ekklesia中，我投票贊成了35個提案，總計2.133億ADA——這比Ekklesia中DReps集體批准的預算低了6200萬ADA。\n\n• 對於我支持的六個提案，存在一個單獨的GA——這些是大多數DReps都認為會對生態系統產生正面影響的頂級項目。\n\n• Intersect的GA包括我想支持的19個提案，總計2.042億ADA，其中包括四個IOG項目，總預算為1.94億ADA。\n\n• 與此同時，有14個總計6550萬ADA的提案是我在Ekklesia中不支持的。\n\n假設IOG能夠為其提案提交自己的GA，那麼我指的是支持15个总预算为1000万ADA的我想要支持的提案。\n\n與此相對的是14個預算為6550萬ADA的我不想支持的提案。\n\n作為一名DRep，我無法接受。\n\n就我而言，這種不平衡使得捆綁方式不可接受。我相信許多DReps也會為此感到困擾。\n\n首選替代方案：\n\n我敦促團隊提交自己的GA，或要求Intersect按類別或門檻組織提案。\n\n• 對個別提案進行鏈上投票是理想的，儘管GA提交的10萬ADA保證金對許多項目來說是一個挑戰。\n\n• 更小、更集中的GA組合將有助於做出更好的決策。\n\nNet Change Limit (NCL) 考量：\n\n目前的NCL尚不明確，使得批准2.75億ADA的預算為時過早。目前有兩個關於NCL的活躍GA：\n\n1. 2億ADA NCL，有效期至2025年5月29日。\n2. 3億ADA NCL，有效期至2025年6月8日。\n\n現有的NCL獲得了強而有力的支持，但許多DReps可能僅僅是為了推動預算流程而支持它，並非因為他們贊成高限額。\n\n在DReps就NCL達成一致之前，批准如此龐大的預算意義不大。\n\n此GA將於2025年6月13日到期。如果兩個活躍的NCL GA均未通過，從而確認了目前的NCL，我仍將有一個epoch的時間重新考慮我的投票。\n\n後續步驟及我的立場：\n\n我敦促DReps盡快對NCL GA進行投票。\n\n我仍然認為，透過對個別提案進行投票，而不是依賴NCL，才能最好地維持預算責任。讓我們在鏈上處理這件事。\n\n我的反對票是向Intersect發出的一個訊號，表明我支持流程變更。我不想批准一個價值2.75億ADA的大型捆綁方案——我更喜歡個別投票或較小的提案組合。\n\n然而，我對我在Ekklesia中投贊成票的項目的支持依然堅定。如果他們提交自己的GA，我會投贊成票。\n\n只要提案透過適當的GA提交流程，我也願意重新考慮所有提案。\n\n最終，我認為理想的NCL應該在2.5億ADA左右，並保留1000万ADA作為應急儲備。\n\n平衡貨幣政策保護和生態系統投資是一項挑戰——我們必須在為成長提供資金的同時，最大限度地減少拋售壓力。\n\n解決方案是確保只有對長期產生正面影響的項目才能從Treasury中獲得ADA。\n\n在我看來，當前捆綁方案中的一些提案是不必要的。\n\n我的DRep ID：\ndrep1km69g7ksf8t5g0h9d9tkrcd2tezxelx0wtr76rv2mrkl5nzd6v3",

          "originalText": "🚫I voted NO on the Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Budget of 275M ADA, administered by Intersect.\n\nRationale:\n\nI strongly oppose bundling all proposals into a single bundle for DReps to approve.\n\nCritical proposals are grouped with less important or unnecessary ones, many of which belong to Catalyst.\n\nBudget responsibility requires making decisions on individual proposals or smaller bundles, not one large one.\n\nProposal Breakdown:\n\n• In Ekklesia, I voted YES for 35 proposals totaling 213.3M ADA—which is 62M ADA lower than the collective DRep-approved budget in Ekklesia.\n\n• A separate GA exists for six of the proposals I supported—these are top-tier projects that most DReps agree will positively impact the ecosystem.\n\n• Intersect’s GA includes 19 proposals I want to support, totaling 204.2M ADA, including four IOG projects with a combined budget of 194M ADA.\n\n• At the same time, 14 proposals totaling 65.5M ADA were proposals I did not support in Ekklesia.\n\nAssuming that IOG is able to submit its own GA for their proposals, I am talking about supporting 15 proposals with a total budget of 10M ADA that I want to support. \n\nAgainst this are 14 proposals with a budget of 65.5M ADA that I do not want to support.\n\nAs a DRep, I cannot accept it.\n\nIn my case, this imbalance makes the bundled approach unacceptable. I believe that many DReps will struggle with this as well.\n\nPreferred Alternative:\n\nI urge teams to submit their own GAs or ask Intersect to structure proposals by category or threshold.\n\n• On-chain voting for individual proposals would be ideal, though the 100K ADA deposit for GA submissions is a challenge for many projects.\n\n• Smaller, more focused GA bundles would allow better decision-making.\n\nNet Change Limit (NCL) Concerns:\n\nThe current NCL is unclear, making a 275M ADA budget approval premature. There are two active GAs regarding NCL:\n\n1. 200M ADA NCL that expires May 29, 2025.\n2. 300M ADA NCL that expires June 8, 2025.\n\nThe existing NCL received strong support, but many DReps may have backed it simply to keep the budget process moving, not because they favored a high limit.\n\nUntil DReps align on the NCL, approving such a large budget makes little sense.\n\nThis GA expires June 13, 2025. If both active NCL GAs fail, confirming the current NCL, I will still have one epoch to reconsider my vote.\n\nNext Steps & My Position:\n\nI urge DReps to vote on the NCL GAs as soon as possible.\n\nI continue to believe that budgetary responsibility is best maintained by voting on individual proposals rather than relying on an NCL. Let’s handle this on-chain.\n\nMy NO vote is a signal to Intersect that I support a process change. I do not want to approve one large bundle worth 275M ADA—I prefer individual votes or smaller proposal bundles.\n\nHowever, my support for the projects I voted YES in Ekklesia remains firm. I will vote YES if they submit their own GA.\n\nI am also open to reconsidering all proposals, as long as they come through proper GA submissions.\n\nUltimately, I believe the ideal NCL should be around 250M ADA, with 10M ADA kept as a reserve for emergencies.\n\nBalancing monetary policy protection and ecosystem investment is a challenge—we must minimize selling pressure while funding growth.\n\nThe solution is ensuring that only projects with a positive long-term impact receive ADA from the Treasury.\n\nIn my view, some proposals in the current bundle are unnecessary.\n\nMy DRep ID:\ndrep1km69g7ksf8t5g0h9d9tkrcd2tezxelx0wtr76rv2mrkl5nzd6v3"

          "text": "投票 ❌：Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Budget - 275M ada Administered by Intersect\n\n===================\n如果您不同意我的反對票，請重新授權給另一位DRep。如果您重新授權給一位投贊成票的DRep，則您的投票將計為贊成票。\n===================\n\n理由\n我投票反對擬議的2025年Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Budget，因為我認為要求的總金額過高，特別是對於最低可行鏈上治理的第一年而言。\n\n我還認為，將39項提案捆綁在一起進行一次投票，限制了DReps表達我們在早期階段看到的那種差異化支持的能力。這種方法抹平了細微差別，並對一系列不同的資金優先事項強加了全有或全無的決定。\n\n我還承認，存在三個創始實體，它們獲得了Genesis ADA，並正在以不同程度的成功努力根據其最初的使命改進Cardano。其中一些使命名義上已經完成，一些使命以其最初的形式繼續存在，一些則以新的形式繼續存在。我不敢說了解所有細微差別。\n\n儘管如此，我還是將其作為我決策的一個因素。Treasury資金的使用應審慎，並應補充和意識到這些實體的存在。\n\n這次投票反對如此大規模的預算是基於：\n\n1. 我參與DRep投票階段以及DRep整體參與程度；\n2. 某些提案相對於其他提案獲得的支持程度；\n3. 某些提案相對於其他提案的相對重要性以及團隊的品質及其對Cardano使命的奉獻精神；\n4. 以及Catalyst很可能（在本次或未來的預算提案中）獲得足夠支持以繼續支持較小的、實驗性的或商業性的專案的期望。\n\n雖然從Treasury支出並非新鮮事（Catalyst以前就這樣做過），但這是第一個主要的年度鏈上預算，它開創了一個先例。\n\n在我看來，問題不在於Cardano經濟體內的通貨膨脹——大多數ADA不會用於購買NFTs或FTs。也不僅僅是略高的通貨緊縮率。更深層次的問題是由於外部拋售壓力導致的ADA貶值。大多數受資助的ADA將被兌換成法定貨幣（USD、EUR等），而不是在內部循環。這給ADA的價格帶來了下行壓力。\n\n這是一個有其怪癖的蹺蹺板。\n\n在現實世界經濟中，如果你投入更多資金來「啟動」經濟，如果服務和商品供應無法滿足需求，就會面臨通貨膨脹。\n\n在一個仍處於萌芽階段的區塊鏈經濟中，投入更多資金基本上意味著將原生代幣兌換成法定貨幣，結果就是貶值。我們不是直接用ADA兌換Cardano經濟商品和服務，而是將其出售到現實世界。ADA沒有在內部循環。這給ADA的價格帶來了下行壓力。\n\n這種貶值影響到每一個人：\n\n1. 最重要的受資助專案\n2. 未獲資助的專案\n3. 未申請資助的建設者\n4. 透過機會成本資助所有這一切的ADA持有者\n\n當然，這是不可避免的。分配的大部分ADA可能會被兌換成法定貨幣（USD、EUR等）用於支付服務，而不是在生態系統內保留或再利用。這造成了匯率壓力，削弱了ADA的價值。\n\n問題不在於是否會發生貶值——它一定會發生。真正的問題是：我們的底線在哪裡？這個預算中的所有39個提案所帶來的價值是否都超過了它們共同造成的貶值成本？我們需要將它們全部捆綁在一個贊成/反對的預算投票中嗎？我認為不需要。\n\n我們正在批准一項龐大的、以外部為重點的預算，而此時Cardano的「區塊鏈經濟」和治理機制仍不成熟且內部脆弱。\n\nTreasury資金應主要集中於不同形式的關鍵公共產品。特別是如果它們是開源的；支持基礎設施、研究、工具，甚至教育、Cardano的推廣。這適用於當這些產品符合Cardano作為公共基礎設施的長期使命時。是的，可能會出現例外情況，但這些例外情況代價高昂——而且其他人會為此買單。\n\n如果我們過度資助影響較小的提案，我們就有可能削弱最關鍵提案的影響力，僅僅因為稀釋了它們所獲得報酬的價值。\n\n因此，我相信一個規模更小、分階段、嚴格關注基礎性公共產品的預算將是一個更好、更安全的起點。\n\n我將此理由作為對擬議預算行動的真誠看法，旨在透過鼓勵提交者（Intersect）考量更多因素來為這一過程做出貢獻。",

          "originalText": "VOTE ❌: Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Budget - 275M ada Administered by Intersect \n\n===================\nPlease redelegate to another DRep, if you disagree with my NO vote. If you redelegate to a YES voting DRep, it will count as a YES. \n===================\n\nRATIONALE\nI am voting NO on the proposed 2025 Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Budget because I believe the total amount requested is too high, especially  for the first year of minimum viable on-chain governance. \n\nI also believe that bundling 39 proposals together into a single vote limits DReps’ ability to express the differentiated support that we saw in earlier stages. This approach flattens nuance and imposes an all-or-nothing decision on a diverse set of funding priorities.\n\nI also acknowledge the existence of the three founding entities that were allocated Genesis ADA that are working with different levels of success to improve Cardano according to their original missions. Some of these missions have been nominally completed, some of these missions continue in their original form, some continue in a new form. I do not pretend to know all the nuances. \n\nStill I take that as a factor in my decision-making. Treasury funds should be used judiciously in complement and in awareness of the existence of the entities. \n\nThis vote against this Budget in its full size is based on:\n\n1. My participation in the DRep voting stage and the level of DRep participation as a whole;\n2. The level of support that some proposals received relative to others;\n3. The relative importance of certain proposals vs others and the quality of the teams and their dedication to Cardano’s mission;\n4. And the expectation that Catalyst will likely gain sufficient support (in this or future budget proposals) to continue to support smaller, experimental, or commercial projects.\n\nWhile spending from the Treasury is not new (Catalyst has done it before), this is the first major annual on-chain budget, and it sets a precedent.\n\nIn my view, the issue is not inflation within the Cardano economy — most ADA will not be used to buy NFTs or FTs. Nor is it simply about a slightly higher disinflation rate. The deeper issue is ADA devaluation due to external sell pressure. Most of the funded ADA will be exchanged for fiat (USD, EUR, etc.), not recycled internally. This adds downward pressure on ADA’s price.\n\nIt is a see-saw that has its quirks. \n\nIn a real-world economy, if you spend more to \"jumpstart\" the economy, face inflation if the supply of services and goods cannot meet demand. \n\nIn a still nascent blockchain economy, spending more essentially means converting the native token for fiat, and the result is devaluation. We are not exchanging ADA directly for Cardano economy goods and services, we are selling it into the real world. The ADA is not recycled internally. This adds downward pressure on ADA’s price.\n\nThis devaluation affects everyone:\n\n1. The most important funded projects\n2. The projects that were not funded\n3. The builders who didn’t ask for funding \n4. The ADA holders who fund all of it through opportunity cost\n\nOf course, that is unavoidable. Most of the ADA allocated will likely be converted to fiat (USD, EUR, etc.) to pay for services, not retained or reused within the ecosystem. This creates exchange rate pressure, weakening ADA’s value.\n\nThe question isn’t whether devaluation will occur — it will. The real question is: Where do we draw the line? Do all 39 proposals in this budget bring more value than the cost of the devaluation they collectively impose? Do we need to bundle them all in one YES/NO budget vote? I think No. \n\nWe are approving a large, externally-focused budget at a time when Cardano’s “blockchain economy” and governance mechanism is still immature and internally fragile.\n\nTreasury funds should primarily be focused on critical public goods in different forms. Especially if they are open source; support infrastructure, research, tools, even education, promotion of Cardano. This applies when the goods align with the long-term mission of Cardano as public infrastructure. Yes, there may be exceptions that emerge, but those exceptions are expensive — and others will pay for them.\n\nIf we overfund less impactful proposals, we risk undermining the impact of the most critical ones, simply by diluting the value of what they are paid in.\n\nFor this reason, I believe a smaller, phased budget focused tightly on foundational public goods would be a better and safer starting point.\n\nI include this rationale as an earnest view of the proposed budget action with the aim of contributing to the process by encouraging the submitter (Intersect) to take more factors into account."

This approach preserves fairness, encourages decentralization, and reinforces the principle that all proposals—regardless of origin—must meet the same community-backed standards.\n| Title                                                             | Ekklesia Vote Count Link                                                                                                                                                 | Allocation (ADA) | Ekklesia Vote Count (ADA)      |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Midgard - Optimistic Rollups                                      | [Link](https://2025budget.intersectmbo.org/ballots/680d1b63565577986442d123/proposals/680d1b64565577986442d276)                                                         | 2,162,096        | 3,580,699,128 ADA             |\n| Starstream: next gen VM[t]                                        | [Link](https://2025budget.intersectmbo.org/ballots/680d1b63565577986442d123/proposals/680d1b64565577986442d2ac)                                                         | 2,000,000        | 3,470,904,894 ADA             |\n| Blockfrost Platform community budget proposal | [Link](https://2025budget.intersectmbo.org/ballots/680d1b63565577986442d123/proposals/680d1b63565577986442d14a)                                                                                                                                                                         | 1,300,000        | 3,185,834,713 ADA             |\n| zkFold ZK Rollup                                                  | [Link](https://2025budget.intersectmbo.org/ballots/680d1b63565577986442d123/proposals/680d1b63565577986442d1c4)                                                         | 1,161,000        | 3,202,699,128 ADA             |\n| Hardware Wallets Maintenance                                      | [Link](https://2025budget.intersectmbo.org/ballots/680d1b63565577986442d123/proposals/680d1b64565577986442d2aa)                                                         | 424,800          | 3,431,605,268 ADA             |\n| Ledger App Rewrite                                                | [Link](https://2025budget.intersectmbo.org/ballots/680d1b63565577986442d123/proposals/680d1b63565577986442d202)                                                         | 300,000          | 2,829,275,087 ADA             |\n| Dolos: Sustaining a Lightweight Cardano Data Node                 | [Link](https://2025budget.intersectmbo.org/ballots/680d1b63565577986442d123/proposals/680d1b64565577986442d29a)                                                         | 220,914          | 2,695,223,782 ADA             |\n|                  | Total Allocation                                                         | 7,568,810          |              |\n\n**Total Allocation**: Sum of all proposals that met threshold of 2.69B minus the founding entity proposals\n\n**Bottom line for DReps**: The 2025 budget is guided by one core question: *What mix of spending best transforms Cardano’s roadmap into real-world adoption and long-term resilience—without overspending the treasury?* The proposed allocations reflect the community’s best answer, shaped by 2024 cost data, strategic modeling, and public feedback.\nThis plan **excludes proposals from founding entities** (Intersect, IOG, Cardano Foundation, Emurgo) and **omits any proposal that failed to meet the 2.69B ADA threshold (50% + 1 Lovelace)**—ensuring that only those with clear community support advance.

          "text": "🔥 #Cardano 治理更新 🔥\n\nCardano 的未來攸關什麼：更新、憲法、金庫和預算。\n\nPlomin Hard Fork \n\n此更新將是全面參與 Cardano 治理的最後一步，該治理按照 CIP-1694 設計。預計 Plomin Hard Fork 很快就會在鏈上提交。幾個月前，當 Chang Hard Fork 實施時，它啟動了 Governance Bootstrap Phase，允許 Delegated Representatives (DReps) 在鏈上註冊，並成立了 Constitutional Committee (CC)，與 Stake Pool Operators (SPOs) 一起對 Governance Actions (GAs) 進行投票。然而，治理是有限的。\n\n一旦 Plomin Hard Fork 通過，DReps 將獲得完整的投票權，而不僅僅是能夠對 Info Actions 進行投票（訪問 https://t.co/aRWErA7Waj 獲取不同類型 Governance Actions 的指南）。這意味著 Cardano Community 將能夠更新 Cardano Constitution 並從 Cardano Treasury 中提取資金。\n\n我們為什麼關心建立憲法和從金庫中提取資金？坦白地說，這是因為 Cardano 已經成長起來，我們現在必須開始獨立生活了。當 Cardano 於 2017 年啟動時，創始實體獲得了 Ada 的資助（約佔總供應量的 20%），以便為我們提供一個我們用戶可以自我治理的去中心化生態系統。現在我們擁有治理的權力，我們需要堅定地制定基本規則，以保護在 Cardano 生態系統中互動的每個人的权利，我們需要共同決定 Cardano 未來的發展路線圖，並且我們需要有辦法為此付費！\n\n憲法\n\n過去幾個月對 Cardano 來說是歷史性的時刻，社群參與了起草新憲法的審議過程。雖然 Chang Hard Fork 建立了一部 Interim Constitution，但該文件在編寫時就帶有明確的替換計畫。@IntersectMBO 在 @InputOutputHK、@Cardano_CF、@emurgo_io 和無數社群貢獻者的幫助下，在全球舉辦了 63 場研討會，從中選出了 Constitutional Convention 的 Delegates。這些 Delegates 參與了綜合會議，審查由 Intersect 的 Cardano Civics Committee 起草的新憲法提案的語言，徵求了社群對擬議變更的意見回饋，然後齊聚 Buenos Aires 和 Nairobi 進行辯論並批准了最終草案。\n\n話雖如此，這部新憲法尚未獲得批准！在像 Cardano 這樣的區塊鏈技術的去中心化生態系統中，新憲法的建立必須得到由其 DReps 代表的 Ada持有者投票贊成後才能生效。一旦 Plomin Hard Fork 通過（祈禱！），社群將能夠考慮一項 Governance Action 來批准新憲法。如果必須，我們可以繼續在 Interim Constitution下運作，但盡快轉向一部源於社群審查過程的新憲法將是更可取的。\n\n金庫\n\nCardano 最獨特和最強大的方面之一是我們擁有一個共同的金庫，用於支持區塊鏈生態系統的運營、維護和未來發展。每個 Epoch，Rewards Pool 的 20%（交易費和貨幣擴張）將進入金庫，其餘部分則用於 Staking Rewards。\n\n由於這個金庫來自本應屬於 Cardano Community 成員的 Staking Rewards，因此必須確保資金的安全。這就是為什麼 Interim Constitution 和擬議的憲法都規定，在進行任何 Treasury Withdrawals 之前，必須通過 Governance Info Action 批准 Net Change Limit。\n\n社群採用的 Net Change Limit 必須明確規定在一定時間內可以從金庫中支出多少 Ada。出於實際目的（至少在我們開始時），這很可能意味著我們決定在 73 個 Epoch（一個日曆年）內支出多少。由於 CC 有義務否決任何不符合既定 Net Change Limit 的 Treasury Withdrawal GA，我們必須確保這個數值符合我們當年的計畫支出，並考虑到可能出現的意外情況。這需要取得微妙的平衡！\n\n預算\n\n除了 Net Change Limit 之外，Interim Constitution 和擬議的憲法都規定，任何 Treasury Withdrawal GA 都不能通過，除非它符合經 Cardano 社群通過 DReps 投票批准的預算。CC 還必須對任何擬議的預算進行投票，以確保擬議的支出不違反憲法。\n\n憲法文本中的預算要求是特意靈活制定的，以便為 Cardano Community 提供資助去中心化生態系統的選項。雖然 Interim Constitution 只是說必須有某個預算存在，但擬議的憲法在描述每個預算如何必須有一個 Administrator 以確保 Treasury Withdrawals 被正確使用方面則更為明確。這個 Administrator 可以是個人、機構或智能合約，我預計這種做法會隨著時間的推移而演變。\n\n雖然 Cardano 上的任何人都可以提議預算，但大量的社群努力一直集中在與 @IntersectMBO 合作，為 2025 年支持 Cardano 提出一份全面的預算。這個過程已接近完成，Budget Committee 表示他們很快就會準備好向社群報告他們的提案。他們已經舉行了多次社群會議，描述了過程並徵求了意見回饋。\n\nIntersect 方法的關鍵之一是確保沒有單一個人負責資金管理。Intersect 將提議的預算會將 Administrator 的職責分配給由 Cardano 社群成員運營的 Intersect 的各個委員會。再次強調，我們正在尋求平衡去中心化的好處與承認授權人們為更大利益行事是推動進程向前發展的最佳方式。\n\n時間表與結論\n\n現在我們已經清楚 Cardano 需要做什麼才能向前發展，我們可以討論每個行動的時間安排。每次提出 Governance Action 時，Cardano 社群都有 6 個 Epoch（30 天）的時間對其進行投票，然後 GA 需要一個 Epoch 才能生效。雖然大多數行動可以提前通過（如果它們獲得了必要的贊成票門檻），但最好保守估計投票將持續整個可能的時间長度。\n\n如果 Plomin Hard Fork GA 在 12 月 21 日（Cardano Epoch 529 開始時）提交，我們預計可能在 1 月 24 日（Epoch 536）生效。屆時，且只有到那時，我們才能合理地提交憲法以供批准。金庫也將解鎖，DReps 可以考慮 Treasury Withdrawal Governance Actions。\n\n雖然金庫將在 1 月 24 日解鎖（前提是 Plomin Hard Fork GA 通過），但在 Net Change Limit 和至少一個預算獲得批准之前，CC 不會批准 DReps 提取資金的任何行動。這意味著我們需要 DReps 和 CC 就 Governance Info Actions 進行投票以批准這些項目，然後才能提交任何 Treasury Withdrawals。\n\n幸運的是，由於 DReps 現在能夠對 Info Actions 進行投票，我們不需要等待 Plomin Hard Fork 生效就可以開始這些討論。社群可以在同一時間窗口內考虑並對 Hard Fork、Net Change Limit 和擬議的預算進行投票。我們有很多重要的問題需要解決，但我相信我們能夠解決它們，並展示去中心化治理如何使一個 Top-10 Blockchain 生態系統不僅能夠運作，而且能夠蓬勃發展！\n\n如果你像我一樣是區塊鏈治理的愛好者，你可能在閱讀這篇文章時一直在點頭，並且一直參與其中。如果你剛剛接觸這個領域並且已經讀到這裡，我希望你能加入我們，邁出旅程的下一個重要步驟。無論如何，假期好好休息一下，因為一月份對 Cardano 來說將是一個激動人心的時刻！",

          "originalText": "🔥 #Cardano Governance Update 🔥\n\nWhat's at stake for the future of Cardano: The Update, The Constitution, the Treasury, and the Budgets.\n\nThe Plomin Hard Fork \n\nThis update will be the final step to full participation in Cardano Governance as designed by CIP-1694. Expect to see the Plomin Hard Fork submitted on chain very soon.  A few months ago, when the Chang Hard Fork was enacted, it activated the Governance Bootstrap Phase which allowed Delegated Representatives (DReps) to register on-chain and established the Constitutional Committee (CC) to vote on Governance Actions (GAs) along with Stake Pool Operators (SPOs).  However, governance was limited.\n\nOnce the Plomin Hard Fork passes the DReps will gain full voting power, not just the ability to vote on Info Actions (visit https://t.co/aRWErA7Waj for a guide to the different type of Governance Actions).  This means that the Cardano Community will be able to update the Cardano Constitution and withdraw funds from the Cardano Treasury.\n\nWhy do we care about establishing the Constitution and withdrawing funds from the Treasury?  Well, quite frankly, it's because Cardano has grown up and we have to start living on our own now.  When Cardano was launched in 2017 the pioneering entities were given grants of Ada (about 20% of the total supply) in order to deliver us a decentralized ecosystem that the we, the users, could govern ourselves.  Now that we have the power of governance we need to firmly set the ground rules that protects the rights of everyone who interacts in the Cardano ecosystem, we need to collectively decide on the future development roadmap of Cardano, and we need to have a way to pay for it!\n\nThe Constitution\n\nThe past few months have been a historic time for Cardano as the community engaged in a deliberative process to draft a new Constitution.  While an Interim Constitution had been established with the Chang Hard Fork that document was written with an intentional plan for replacement.  @IntersectMBO with the help of @InputOutputHK, @Cardano_CF, @emurgo_io, and countless community contributors held 63 workshops across the world where Delegates for a Constitutional Convention were selected. These Delegates participated in synthesis sessions to review the language of the proposed new constitution that had been drafted by the Cardano Civics Committee of Intersect, solicited community feedback on proposed changes, and then came together in Buenos Aires and Nairobi to debate and approve a final draft.\n\nAll that being said, this new Constitution is not yet approved!  In a decentralized ecosystem of blockchain technology like Cardano, the establishment of a new Constitution cannot be valid until the Ada holders, as represented by their DReps, vote in favor.  Once the Plomin Hard Fork has passed (fingers crossed!) the community will be able to consider a Governance Action to ratify the new Constitution.  We can continue to operate under the Interim Constitution, if we must, but it would be far preferable to move to a new Constitution that came from a community review process as soon as possible.\n\nThe Treasury\n\nOne of the most unique and powerful aspects of Cardano is that we have a common Treasury to provide for the operation, maintenance, and future development of the blockchain ecosystem. Each Epoch, 20% of the Rewards Pool (transaction fees and monetary expansion) goes to the Treasury instead while the rest goes to Staking Rewards.\n\nBecause this Treasury comes out of the Staking Rewards that would otherwise go to the members of the Cardano Community, it is essential that the fund be safeguarded.  That is why the Interim Constitution and the proposed Constitution both specify that a Net Change Limit must be approved through a Governance Info Action before any Treasury Withdrawals are made.\n\nThe Net Change Limit that is adopted by the community must define how much Ada can be spent out of the Treasury in a certain amount of time.  For practical purposes (at least as we start), this will most likely mean that we decide how much to spend in 73 epochs (a calendar year).  Because the CC is obligated to vote down any Treasury Withdrawal GA that does not fit within the established Net Change Limit, we must make sure that this value fits within our planned spending for the year and allows for contingencies that may come up.  There is a fine balance to be struck!\n\nThe Budgets\n\nIn addition to the Net Change Limit, the Interim Constitution and the proposed Constitution specify that the no Treasury Withdrawal GA can pass unless it fits within a Budget that has been approved by the Cardano community through a vote by DReps.  The CC must also vote on any proposed budget to ensure that proposed spending does not violate the Constitution.\n\nWith text of the Constitution, the Budget requirements are purposefully flexible to give the Cardano Community options to fund the decentralized ecosystem.  While the Interim Constitution simply says there must be some Budget in place, the proposed Constitution is a bit more explicit in describing how each Budget must have an Administrator to ensure Treasury Withdrawals are properly spent.  This Administrator could be a person, an institution, or a smart contract, and I expect we will see this practice evolve over time.\n\nWhile anyone on Cardano can propose a budget, a large amount of community effort has been focused on working with @IntersectMBO to propose a comprehensive budget to support Cardano in 2025.  This process is nearing completion and the Budget Committee has stated they will be ready to report their proposal to the community soon.  They have already held numerous community meetings describing the process and soliciting feedback.\n\nOne of the keys to Intersect's approach will be to ensure that there is no single person in charge of the administration of funds.  The Budgets that Intersect will propose will give Administrator responsibilities to various committees of Intersect that are run by Cardano community members.  Again, we are seeking to balance the benefits of decentralization with the recognition that empowering people to act for the greater good is the best way to move a process forward.\n\nThe Timeline & Conclusion\n\nNow that we have a clear picture on what needs to happen for Cardano to move forward, we can discuss the timing of each action. Each time a Governance Action is proposed the Cardano community has 6 Epochs (30 days) to vote on it and then it takes one Epoch for the GA to take effect.  While most actions can pass early (if they get the necessary threshold of Yes votes) it is best to make a conservative estimate that the vote will run the full length of time possible.\n\nIf the Plomin Hard Fork GA is submitted on December 21 (the beginning of Cardano Epoch 529) we are looking at probable enactment on January 24 (Epoch 536).  Then, and only then, can we reasonably submit the Constitution for ratification.  The Treasury will also be unlocked and DReps can consider Treasury Withdrawal Governance Actions.\n\nWhile the Treasury will be unlocked on January 24, provided that the Plomin Hard Fork GA passes, the CC will not approve any actions the DReps take to withdraw funds unless the Net Change Limit and at least one Budget have been approved.  That means that we will need to have the DReps and CC vote on Governance Info Actions to approve these items before any Treasury Withdrawals are submitted.\n\nFortunately, because DReps are able to vote for Info Actions right now, we do not need to wait for the Plomin Hard Fork to be enacted to begin these discussions.  The community can consider and vote on the Hard Fork, the Net Change Limit, and the proposed Budgets within the same window of time.  We have a lot of important issues to figure out but I am confident that we can work through them and show how decentralized governance can make a Top-10 Blockchain ecosystem not just function but thrive!\n\nIf you're a Blockchain Governance nerd like me, you've probably been nodding along as you read this and have been along for the ride up to this point.  If you're just getting into it and have read this far, I hope you'll join us for the next big step of the journey.  Either way, get some rest over the holidays, because January is going to be an exciting time for Cardano!"

By voting, DReps will shape the ecosystem’s trajectory while directly informing current and future budget discussions.\n\nAs the budget process advances, the outcome will ensure development efforts align with community consensus, guiding resource allocation to maximize impact. A unified roadmap strengthens accountability, transparency, and cohesion across the ecosystem - all key to advancing Cardano’s long-term adoption and competitive edge.\n\nLearn more about the roadmap here ➡️ https://t.co/dYqUlyzL52\n\nDReps cast your vote via GovTool ➡️ https://t.co/yVMpdkUGWa"

We’re in a historical transition.\n\nOur responsibility is to document this process—its flaws, its breakthroughs, and everything in between—so that what we leave behind is a legacy, not just a result.\n\nIn this way, our mistakes and successes both become tools for future growth.\n\n🔁 I believe the Cardano ecosystem must thrive through free and open competition.\n\nFor that to happen, any proposal or authority must be evaluated and, if necessary, challenged openly.\n\nAnd that starts with us—with the community choosing to observe, report, and remember.\n\nCardano will evolve through our collective will and action.\n\nLet’s build something we can be proud to pass on.\nLet me know if you’d like this adapted for a Twitter/X thread or shortened for another format!"

My reasons for this are well documented, but primarily relate to the emissions-price pressure-value add relationships.\n\nCore dev\nA reasonable proposal by IOG to keep delivering on critical roadmap items would get my instant support. In my view the one we have seen on gov tools ticks that box, if with a slightly hefty ask. Also assuming no surprises, I’d approve associated forks and changes. \n\nI am aware others besides IOG could do some of the work, but I think a safe approach in the first years of governance would be to only gradually diversify the work beyond IOG, rather than pull away from them immediately. Again, being conservative.\n\nHigh impact cost efficient proposals\nCost efficient, high impact technology efforts by other, ideally proven, actors. Think Midgard, Starstream or alternative nodes for single digit millions of ADA. Willing to entertain all similar impact and cost efficient ones.\n\nOrgs\nAssorted spending for Intersect and similar orgs pushing Cardano forward, if the asks are reasonable and well documented / detailed. Smaller asks will naturally be an easier yes.\n\nCatalyst and/or Intersect budget\nA slimmed down version of Catalyst to capture a lot of the efforts others want to put forward. Catalyst is a system that is not perfect, but is improving (eg quadratic voting) and is the current best framework we have for such things. Intersect might complement this, but needs to prove itself.\n\nSummary\nThis covers core tech, non core tech innovation, orgs and all the other proposals via Intersect/Catalyst.\n\nI think at a high level it should in principle be possible to fit all the above into a NCL of 150m ADA, though that would require some frugality on the part of all participants.\n\nMy stance on governance is that it should be transparent and on-chain wherever possible. I am currently unsure whether the Intersect budget process is as robust as what we have in place with Catalyst, and in any case it would need to prove itself.\n\nTherefore my preference would be to pull some of the tech related ones that I mentioned out of this process, and put them to a direct DRep vote fairly soon. Shrink down both Catalyst/Intersect budgets significantly and put them to a vote. I’ll likely support them."

          "text": "關於淨變化限額和預算提案\n\n作為一名 DRep，我對有關淨變化限額 (NCL) 的兩項治理行動 (GA) 都投了贊成票。\n\n現階段看來，第二項 GA 將獲得批准，將 NCL 設定為 3.5 億 ADA。\n\n根據我的民意調查意見回饋，社群中有相當一部分人認為這個數字過高。\n\n一些 DReps 現在正將其最初的贊成票改為反對票。\n\n在正在進行的關於是否批准第二項有關 NCL 的 GA 的民意調查中，結果是各佔一半。\n\n我將維持我的贊成立場，並將概述原因。\n\n現在已接近四月底，但批准的 NCL 仍懸而未決。 生態系統迫切需要資金分配以資助發展計畫。 進一步拖延等待另一個 GA 週期將適得其反。\n\n重要的是要考虑到許多 DReps 傾向於在最後階段投票，而 GA 批准通常需要大約六個時期（約一個月）。\n\n如果這項提案獲得批准，金庫資金的支付最早可能在五月或六月開始。 希望如此！\n\n是的，高 NCL 存在風險——它增加了金庫大幅提取的可能性。\n\n同樣值得強調的是，DReps 有權批准遠低於既定 NCL 的支出。\n\n社群中有些聲音警告說，總支出可能會接近 NCL，彷彿這是一個必然的結果。 在我看來，這聽起來更像是世界末日的景象，而不是現實的預測。\n\n責任最終在於 DReps。 如果每項資金決策都根據其自身的價值進行評估，那麼這種超支是可以——也應該——避免的。\n\n我將支持一項提議較低 NCL 的新 GA，大約在 2 億到 2.5 億 ADA 之間。 我很可能會對此投贊成票。\n\n我知道存在一些大型 DRep（包括一個創始實體）立場非常強硬，可能會拒絕批准較低 NCL 的風險。\n\n我目前正在審查預算提案，並確定了大約 20 項我傾向於支持的提案。\n\n最初，我假設 1.5 億 ADA 足以作為我個人的 NCL 門檻。\n\n然而，IOG 約 9700 萬 ADA 的請求和 Catalyst 約 7000 萬 ADA 的請求迫使我提高這一估計。\n\n我傾向於暫時不設定固定限額，因為新的提案不斷湧現。 不過，我的目標是支持低於 2.5 億 ADA 的總體 NCL。\n\n我真的希望我能將其控制在 2 億 ADA 左右。\n\n我仍然強烈傾向於 Catalyst 而非預算提案。\n\n為什麼？\n\n因為大多數 DReps 表示願意每月只花一天時間參與治理。\n\n目前，有 150 項提案，總計要求 4.8 億 ADA。\n\n依賴那些可能在每項提案上只花幾分鐘時間的人做決策是危險的。 有些提案可能完全被忽視。這是不負責任的。\n\n我的策略保持不變：我將只支持少數幾個必要的預算提案以及 Catalyst。\n\n大多數項目應該通過 Catalyst 尋求資金。\n\nCatalyst 提供了幾個明顯的優勢：\n\n• 一個經過多年成熟的框架。\n\n• 團隊熟悉其流程。\n\n• 每輪的資金上限引入了一定程度的財政紀律。\n\n• DReps 可以參與社群審查並指導 ADA 持有者如何投票。\n\n相比之下，預算提案系統完全未經檢驗，其背後的團隊也基本上不為人所知。\n\n此外，Intersect 需要高昂的運營成本。\n\n將數億 ADA 分配給一個未經證實的系統幾乎沒有意義。\n\n這種機制應該首先用有限的資金進行測試。 如果成功，才可以委託其管理更大份額的金庫資源。\n\n有趣的是，我的民意調查顯示，雖然人們傾向於預算提案，但對 Catalyst 的支持依然存在。\n\n一些受訪者對這兩種機制都不信任。\n\n我每天都會關注治理進展，並根據需要進行調整。\n\n如果我最終決定將我的 NCL 投票改為「否」，我會及時通知。 截至目前，我沒有這樣的打算。\n\n感謝大家的意見回饋。\n\n我的 DRep ID：\ndrep1km69g7ksf8t5g0h9d9tkrcd2tezxelx0wtr76rv2mrkl5nzd6v3",

          "originalText": "On the Net Change Limit and Budget Proposals\n\nAs a DRep, I cast a YES vote to approve both governance actions (GA) concerning the Net Change Limit (NCL).\n\nAt this stage, it appears the second GA will be ratified, setting the NCL at 350M ADA.\n\nBased on feedback from my poll, a substantial portion of the community views this figure as excessive. \n\nSome DReps are now switching their original YES vote to NO.\n\nIn the ongoing poll on whether to approve the second GA regarding NCL or not, the result is half and half.\n\nI will maintain my YES stance, and I’ll outline why.\n\nWe are nearing the end of April, yet an approved NCL is still pending. The ecosystem urgently needs capital allocation to fund development initiatives. Delaying further to wait for another GA cycle would be counterproductive.\n\nIt’s important to consider that many DReps tend to vote in the final stages, and GA ratification typically takes around six epochs (approximately one month). \n\nIf this proposal is ratified, disbursement from the Treasury could begin in May or June. Hopefully!\n\nYes, a high NCL carries risk—it increases the likelihood of aggressive Treasury drawdowns.\n\nIt’s also worth emphasizing that DReps have the authority to approve spending far below the defined NCL. \n\nSome voices in the community warn that total expenditures might approach NCL, as if this were a guaranteed outcome. To me, that sounds like a doomsday scenario rather than a realistic forecast. \n\nThe responsibility ultimately lies with the DReps. If each funding decision is evaluated on its individual merits, such overspending can—and should—be avoided.\n\nI would support a new GA that proposes a lower NCL, somewhere between 200M and 250M ADA. I would likely vote YES for that.\n\nI am aware of the risk that a few big DReps, including one founding entity, have a very strong position and may refuse to approve a lower NCL.\n\nI am currently reviewing Budget Proposals and have identified around 20 of them that I am inclined to support.\n\nInitially, I assumed that 150M ADA would suffice as my personal NCL threshold. \n\nHowever, IOG’s request for ~97M ADA and Catalyst’s request for ~70M ADA compel me to raise that estimate. \n\nI prefer not to set a fixed limit yet, as new proposals continue to surface. Still, I aim to support an overall NCL below 250M ADA. \n\nI really hope I manage to keep it around 200M ADA.\n\nMy preference continues to lean strongly toward Catalyst over Budget Proposals.\n\nWhy? \n\nBecause most DReps have indicated a willingness to dedicate just one day per month to governance. \n\nAt present, there are 150 proposals requesting a total of 480M ADA. \n\nIt is dangerous to rely on decision-making by individuals who may spend just a few minutes per proposal. Some proposals may be overlooked entirely. That’s irresponsible.\n\nMy strategy remains unchanged: I will back only a few essential Budget Proposals alongside Catalyst. \n\nMost projects should seek funding through Catalyst.\n\nCatalyst offers several clear advantages:\n\n• A framework that has matured over the years.\n\n• Teams are familiar with their processes.\n\n• Funding caps per round introduce a level of fiscal discipline.\n\n• DReps can participate in community reviews and guide ADA holders on how to vote.\n\nBy contrast, the Budget Proposals system is completely untested, and the team behind it remains largely unknown. \n\nMoreover, Intersect requires a high operational cost.\n\nIt makes little sense to allocate hundreds of millions of ADA to a system that hasn't been proven.\n\nThis mechanism should be tested first, with limited funds. If successful, it could then be entrusted with a larger portion of Treasury resources.\n\nInterestingly, my poll shows that while there is a preference for Budget Proposals, support for Catalyst remains. \n\nSome respondents distrust both mechanisms.\n\nI monitor governance developments daily and will adapt as needed. \n\nIf I ultimately decide to change my NCL vote to NO, I’ll communicate that promptly. As of now, I have no such intention.\n\nThank you all for the feedback.\n\nMy DRep ID:\ndrep1km69g7ksf8t5g0h9d9tkrcd2tezxelx0wtr76rv2mrkl5nzd6v3"

          "text": "我的預算提案理由\n\n我支持了 23 個項目，總計 2.222 億 ADA。 我對其餘所有項目都投了反對票。\n\n各類別支持的項目數量：\n\n• 核心：17\n• 研究：2\n• 市場行銷與創新：2\n• 治理支持：2\n\n我支持的 3 個最大的項目是 IOG 核心開發、IO 研究和 Catalyst。\n\n這 3 個項目佔了 1.93 億 ADA。\n\n我曾猶豫是否支持 IOG 的研究。 過去發表了很多學術論文。我們明年不需要清單上的所有研究項目。 現在有必要更多地支持實施和生態系統，在我看來，這方面落後於研究。\n\n另一方面，Cardano 的成功很大程度上是基於研究和使用形式化方法的高質量實施。\n\n不支持研究將是倒退。清單上的一些項目可能會在未來實施。\n\n我下次的建議是為每個項目創建一個單獨的提案，而不是一個包含許多項目的提案。 這也適用於核心開發。\n\n正如我之前提到的，我認為 Catalyst 是大多數項目應該申請資金的地方。 這就是我支持它的原因。\n\n在審查預算提案期間，我注意到在許多情況下，只有大約 2-3 名 DReps 投票。 在最好的情況下，大約有 10 名，很少有大約 20 名。這是一個非常低的參與率。\n\nCatalyst 並不完美，但它已經改進了好幾年，團隊經驗豐富，而且它是一個經過實戰檢驗的工具。 ADA 持有者已經熟悉該系統。此外，還計畫進行進一步的改進。\n\n目前，我認為沒有理由用預算提案取代 Catalyst。\n\n我的另一個建議是，一旦 NCL 獲得批准，IOG 應該為其提案提交單獨的 GA。 這將避免 DReps 在一個 GA 中對包含許多其他項目的 GA 進行投票的情況。\n\n我只用了 2900 萬 ADA 來支持其他 23 個項目。\n\n這些項目，在我看來，是生態系統迫切需要的。\n\n我認為 Midgard、Starstream、Hydra、ZK Rollups、一個替代的 Cardano 節點、與 Bitcoin 的集成以及其他幾個項目是必不可少的項目。\n\n如果我遇到多個類似的提案，我更傾向於開源項目和社群熟知的實體，或者那些已經交付了至今仍在使用的項目的實體。\n\n我想強調的是，如果我投了反對票，可能意味著：\n\n• 我不喜歡這個項目。 它不應該從金庫（或 Catalyst）獲得資金。\n\n• 我喜歡這個項目，它應該從 Catalyst 申請資金。\n\n總的來說，我認為有商業成功雄心的項目應該尋找其他資金來源。\n\n我不喜歡風險業務從金庫獲得資助，而在成功的情況下利潤被私有化的情況。\n\n如果項目申請金庫資金，它們應該制定一個策略，說明如何在成功的情況下將部分利潤返還給社群。\n\n此外，我認為如果是一家新創公司，團隊不能期望開發人員獲得與 IOG 開發人員相同的薪水。 部分風險必須由團隊承擔，而不僅僅是金庫。\n\n有些項目沒有商業性質，例如函式庫、開發工具等。我們應該識別這些項目，評估它們的益處，並可能支持它們。\n\n我支持的最後一個主要項目是 Cardano 基金會的行銷策略。 這也包括 Cardano 高峰會。\n\n總的來說，我不想支持那些持有 Genesis 代幣但尚未使用它們的創始實體的項目。 Cardano 基金會就是這樣一個實體，這在上次 Catalyst 基金中產生了負面影響。\n\n另一方面，這項提案是行銷類別中最好的。 Cardano 基金會支持生態系統中的許多活動。CF 希望長期保持活躍並支持生態系統建設，為此它需要獲得資金。\n\nCardano 高峰會和其他行銷活動的成本可能很高。 我不希望冒險，如果他們的提案未獲批准，下一屆 Cardano 高峰會將無法舉辦。 加密貨幣行業可能會對此產生負面看法。\n\n我只支持了 Intersect 關於開源開發預算的一項提案。 他們要求 580 萬 ADA。\n\n每天都有新的提案出現，所以我的決定可能不是最終的。 我可能會做出改變。\n\n我的 DRep ID：\ndrep1km69g7ksf8t5g0h9d9tkrcd2tezxelx0wtr76rv2mrkl5nzd6v3",

          "originalText": "My Rationale for Budget Proposals\n\nI supported 23 projects totaling 222.2M ADA. I voted NO for all others.\n\nNumber of supported projects across categories:\n\n• Core: 17\n• Research: 2\n• Marketing & Innovation: 2\n• Governance support: 2\n\nThe 3 largest projects I supported are IOG Core development, IO Research, and Catalyst. \n\nThese 3 items account for 193M ADA.\n\nI was hesitant to support IOG research. In the past, many academic papers have been published. We do not need all the research items on the list for next year. Now it is necessary to support implementation and the ecosystem more, which, in my opinion, is lagging behind research.\n\nOn the other hand, Cardano's success is largely based on research and quality implementation using formal methods. \n\nNot supporting research would be a step aside. Some of the things on the list may be implemented in the future.\n\nMy recommendation for next time is to create a separate proposal for each item instead of one proposal with many items. This also applies to Core development.\n\nAs I mentioned before, I consider Catalyst to be the place where most projects should apply for funding. That is why I support it.\n\nDuring the review of Budget Proposals, I noticed that in many cases, only about 2-3 DReps voted. In the best case, about 10, rarely around 20. This is a very low participation.\n\nCatalyst is not perfect, but it has been improved for several years, the team is experienced, and it is a battle-tested tool. ADA holders are already familiar with the system. Moreover, further improvements are planned.\n\nAt this point, I see no reason to replace Catalyst with Budget Proposals.\n\nMy other recommendation is that IOG should submit separate GAs for their proposals once the NCL is approved. This will avoid the situation where DReps vote on a GA with many other items in one GA.\n\nI only used 29M ADA to support the other 23 projects. \n\nThese are projects that, in my opinion, the ecosystem desperately needs.\n\nI consider Midgard, Starstream, Hydra, ZK Rollups, an alternative Cardano node, integration with Bitcoin, and several others to be must-have projects.\n\nIf I came across multiple similar proposals, I preferred open-source projects and entities that are well-known to the community or have delivered a project that is still in use today.\n\nI would like to emphasize that if I voted NO, it could mean:\n\n• I don't like the project. It shouldn't be funded from Treasury (or Catalyst).\n\n• I like the project, and it should apply for funding from Catalyst.\n\nIn general, I think that projects with ambitions to be commercially successful should look for other sources of funding. \n\nI don't like it when a risky business is funded from the Treasury, and in case of success, the profit is privatized.\n\nIf projects apply for Treasury funding, they should have a strategy on how to return part of the profit back to the community in case of success.\n\nFurthermore, I think that if it is a startup, the team cannot expect that devs will be paid the same salaries as IOG devs. Part of the risk must be borne by the team, not just Treasury.\n\nSome projects do not have a commercial character, for example, libraries, dev tools, etc. We should identify these projects, evaluate their benefits, and possibly support them.\n\nThe last major project I supported was the Marketing Strategy from the Cardano Foundation. This also includes the Cardano Summit.\n\nIn general, I do not want to support projects from founding entities that hold Genesis coins and have not spent them yet. The Cardano Foundation is such an entity, which was negatively reflected in the last Catalyst Fund.\n\nOn the other hand, this proposal was the best in the marketing category. The Cardano Foundation supports many activities in the ecosystem. CF wants to remain active in the long term and support building the ecosystem, for which it needs to secure funding.\n\nThe costs of the Cardano Summit and other marketing activities can be high. I would not like to risk that if their proposal is not approved, the next Cardano Summit will not be organized. The crypto industry could perceive this negatively.\n\nI have only supported a single proposal from Intersect regarding the budget for open-source development. They are asking for 5.8M ADA.\n\nNew proposals appear every day, so my decision may not be final.  I may make changes.\n\nMy DRep ID:\ndrep1km69g7ksf8t5g0h9d9tkrcd2tezxelx0wtr76rv2mrkl5nzd6v3"

          "text": "我投票反對 ⛔️ 將淨變化限額 (NCL) 降至 2 億 ADA，這是迄今為止最艱難的治理決策之一。\n\n感覺這裡沒有完全好的選項。\n\n此外，我自己也曾呼籲降低 NCL。\n\n目前 3.5 億 ADA 的 NCL 有一些明顯的缺點。\n\n如果巨大的拋售壓力導致 ADA 價格大幅下跌，比如說跌至 0.2 美元，則可能導致嚴重的挑戰。\n\n以美元計價為生態系統提供資金將需要從國庫中出售大量 ADA，從而導致拋售壓力的螺旋式上升，從而使情況惡化。\n\nCardano Whale (@cardano_whale) 指出，像 Tezos 和 Polkadot 這樣的一些項目在其生態系統中投入了大量資金，擁有創新技術，但仍難以獲得實質性的關注。\n\n我完全同意這一點。\n\n對於區塊鏈而言，保持在前十大市值排名中的地位至關重要。\n\n散戶投資者、機構和加密貨幣愛好者不僅根據技術，還根據市場表現來評估項目。\n\n如果 Cardano 長期跌出前十，無論其去中心化程度或像 Ouroboros Leios 這樣的技術進步如何，它可能永遠無法恢復其地位。\n\n這是一個需要考慮的重要因素，即使它感覺不公平或主觀。\n\n另一方面，將 NCL 降至 2 億 ADA 也有其自身的擔憂。\n\nCardano 需要投資來推進其技術、支持建設者並發展生態系統。 如果沒有增加的用戶活動，金庫收入就不會增長。\n\n未來幾年的維護和開發支出可能會耗盡儲備金，最終使 Cardano 在經濟上不可持續。\n\n協議安全性還取決於有吸引力的質押獎勵和激勵措施。 此外，如果沒有活躍的開發人員、工具和不斷發展的 DeFi 生態系統，Ouroboros Leios 的潛力將無法發揮。 所有這些領域的投資都至關重要。\n\nIOG 已經明確了他們的資金需求：核心開發需要 9600 萬 ADA，Catalyst 需要 6900 萬 ADA，研究需要 2700 萬 ADA。 總計 1.92 億 ADA。IOG 的提議很簡單：要么批准這筆資金，要么就算了。\n\n關於公平性、IOG 和 Charles 過去的貢獻以及 Cardano「完成」的定義的爭論自有其道理，但現實是 IOG 在協議方面擁有無與倫比的專業知識。 沒有其他實體能夠以同樣的速度或質量有效地接管維護、開發和研究。\n\n如果 DReps 將 1.92 億 ADA 分配給 IOG，那麼其他項目只剩下 800 萬 ADA。\n\n在審查了預算提案後，我只支持了我認為生態系統絕對需要的那些基本項目：像 Midgard、Starstream、Hydra、ZK Rollups、Blockfrost、Lucid、Chainlink 集成等等。\n\n僅核心類別一項，就大約需要 1200 萬 ADA。 在所有類別中，我批准的總預算為 2.13 億 ADA。\n\n鑑於我自己估計所需支出為 2.13 億 ADA，我不能支持 2 億 ADA 的 NCL。\n\n這將與我對必要項目資金的立場與我批准的上限相矛盾。 這種不一致性導致我決定投票反對降低 NCL。\n\nCardano 需要有效的市場行銷和改進的治理支持，因為目前的情況遠非理想。\n\n投資生態系統和推進新技術必須齊頭並進，以確保可持續增長。\n\n在我看來，批准 2 億 ADA 的 NCL 將意味著維持現狀，將所有關鍵職責留給 IOG，同時忽視對更廣泛生態系統的投資。\n\n從本質上講，這將限制對生態系統至關重要的實體的資金，就像 IOG 一樣。\n\n一個重要的考慮因素是圍繞 NCL 的預期情景。\n\n在我看來，3.5 億 ADA 和 2 億 ADA 的 NCL 都是極端的。\n\n目前的 NCL 定為 3.5 億 ADA，得到了 76% 參與投票權益的有力支持。 幾乎所有的投票權益都批准了它。將 NCL 從 3.5 億大幅削減至 2 億 ADA，要麼是不負責任的，要麼是過於雄心勃勃的。\n\n接下來會發生什麼？ 建設者、Intersect、IOG 或其他人可能會提交一項新的治理行動，提議一個中間的 NCL，也許是 2.5 億或 3 億 ADA。 或者，可以同時提交多個提案。\n\n這種情況會造成一個不穩定的環境，這種環境是適得其反且難以支持的。 這種不穩定性會破壞進步。\n\n此外，加密社群對 Cardano 生態系統能夠負擔多少投資的冗長辯論興趣不大。\n\n在不穩定的環境中，即使提出一個連貫的預算也幾乎是不可能的。\n\n目前，我們的 NCL 為 3.5 億 ADA。 考慮一下這個可能的情景：\n\nIntersect 預計將提交一項於六月到期的預算治理行動。 與此同時，如果到五月底批准了新的 2 億 ADA NCL，那麼除非在新的 NCL 生效前批准預算提案，否則該提案實際上將變得違憲。\n\n這使過程複雜化，並進一步凸顯了突然、極端變化帶來的問題。\n\n通過治理行動來辯論 NCL 既效率低下又過於耗時。\n\n社群的共識似乎很可能在 2.5 億至 3 億 ADA 之間。 然而，在鏈上投票之前沒有進行鏈下溫度檢查（大多數社群會對此做出回應），這導致目前的 NCL 僅僅為了讓預算過程得以繼續而被批准。\n\nNCL 本身的概念開始讓人覺得沒有必要，因為它總是根據多數票而變化。 如果投票權益同意增加或減少 NCL，這必然會發生。\n\n重要的是要強調，NCL 並不決定必須從國庫中支出的金額。 每項提款提案仍需社群批准。\n\n如果目前的提案在 2.5 億至 3 億 ADA 的範圍內，我可能會投贊成票。 如果提交了這樣的提案，我會支持它，因為它符合我認為基於我已認可的提案的合理預算。\n\n然而，我的決定並非最終決定，可能會根據未來治理方面的發展而改變。\n\n例如，如果治理行動將多個提案合併導致總成本過高，或者如果 IOG 提案與我不支持的幾個提案或我強烈反對的一個提案（例如 Daedalus 2025 服務增強提案）組合在一起，我可能會重新考慮我的立場。\n\n如果避免糟糕預算結果的唯一方法是投票支持較低的 NCL，我準備這樣做。 這個決定是微妙的，不能非黑即白地看待。\n\n我希望避免出現批准較低 NCL 不可避免地導致另一次 GA 提交的情況。 反覆處理 NCL 既耗時又沒有成效。\n\nDReps 需要優先處理預算提案。\n\n如果最終資助的是低質量項目，那麼較高的 NCL 就毫無意義。\n\n我的 DRep ID：\ndrep1km69g7ksf8t5g0h9d9tkrcd2tezxelx0wtr76rv2mrkl5nzd6v3",

          "originalText": "I voted NO ⛔️to reduce the Net Change Limit (NCL) to 200M ADA, which has been one of the toughest governance decisions so far. \n\nIt feels like there’s no entirely good option here.\n\nMoreover, I myself called for a lower NCL.\n\nThe current NCL of 350M ADA has some notable drawbacks.\n\nIf high selling pressure causes ADA’s price to drop significantly, say to 0.2 USD, it could result in serious challenges. \n\nFunding the ecosystem in dollar terms would require selling a large amount of ADA from the treasury, leading to a spiral of selling pressure that could worsen the situation.\n\nCardano Whale (@cardano_whale) pointed out that some projects like Tezos and Polkadot have invested heavily in their ecosystems, possess innovative technologies, yet struggle to gain substantial attention.\n\nI fully agree with that.\n\nFor blockchains, maintaining a presence in the top 10 market capitalization rankings is vital.\n\nRetail investors, institutions, and crypto enthusiasts evaluate projects not only based on technology but also on market performance. \n\nIf Cardano drops out of the top 10 for an extended period, it may never regain its position, regardless of decentralization or technological progress like Ouroboros Leios. \n\nThis is an important factor to consider, even if it feels unfair or subjective.\n\nOn the other hand, reducing the NCL to 200M ADA comes with its own set of concerns.\n\nCardano needs investments to advance its technology, support builders, and develop the ecosystem. Without increased user activity, Treasury revenue won't grow. \n\nSpending on maintenance and development in the next years risks exhausting the reserve, ultimately making Cardano economically unsustainable.\n\nProtocol security also hinges on attractive staking rewards and incentives. Moreover, Ouroboros Leios’s potential will remain untapped without active developers, tools, and a growing DeFi ecosystem. Investments in all these areas are crucial.\n\nIOG has made their funding requirements clear: Core Dev needs 96M ADA, Catalyst 69M ADA, and Research 27M ADA. Combined, this totals 192M ADA. The offer from IOG is simple: either approve this funding or let it be.\n\nDebates around fairness, IOG and Charles’s past contributions, and the definition of “completion” for Cardano have their place, but the reality is that IOG holds unmatched expertise in the protocol. No other entity can effectively take over maintenance, development, and research at the same pace or quality.\n\nIf DReps allocate 192M ADA to IOG, only 8M ADA remains for other projects.\n\nAfter reviewing budget proposals, I supported only the essentials I believe the ecosystem absolutely needs: projects like Midgard, Starstream, Hydra, ZK Rollups, Blockfrost, Lucid, Chainlink integration, and others. \n\nFor the CORE category alone, this amounts to around 12M ADA. Across all categories, my total approved budget comes to 213M ADA.\n\nGiven my own estimate of required expenditures is 213M ADA, I cannot support an NCL of 200M ADA. \n\nIt would contradict my stance on necessary project funding versus the cap I approve. This inconsistency guided my decision to vote NO on reducing the NCL.\n\nCardano requires effective marketing and improved governance support, as the current situation is far from ideal.\n\nInvesting in the ecosystem and advancing new technologies must go hand in hand to ensure sustainable growth.\n\nApproving the NCL of 200M ADA, in my view, would mean preserving the status quo, leaving all key responsibilities to IOG while neglecting investment in the broader ecosystem. \n\nEssentially, it would restrict funding for entities that are vital to the ecosystem, just as IOG is.\n\nAn important consideration is the expected scenarios surrounding the NCL.\n\nBoth NCLs, an NCL of 350M ADA and 200M ADA, are extremes in my view.\n\nThe current NCL, set at 350M ADA, has strong support with 76% of the voting stake participating. Nearly the entire voting stake approved it. Drastically reducing the NCL from 350M to 200M ADA would be either irresponsible or overly ambitious.\n\nWhat would happen next? Builders, Intersect, IOG, or others would likely submit a new governance action proposing an intermediate NCL, perhaps 250M or 300M ADA. Alternatively, multiple proposals could be submitted simultaneously.\n\nThis scenario would create an unstable environment that is counterproductive and difficult to support. Such instability undermines progress.\n\nMoreover, the crypto community has little interest in prolonged debates about how much the Cardano ecosystem can afford to invest.\n\nIn an unstable environment, even proposing a coherent budget becomes nearly impossible.\n\nCurrently, we have an NCL of 350M ADA. Consider this likely scenario:\n\nIntersect is expected to submit a governance action for the budget expiring in June. Meanwhile, if a new NCL of 200M ADA is approved by the end of May, the proposed budget would effectively become unconstitutional unless it is approved before the new NCL takes effect. \n\nThis complicates the process and further highlights the issues with sudden, extreme changes.\n\nDebating the NCL through governance actions is both inefficient and overly time-consuming.\n\nIt seems likely that the community's consensus would fall somewhere between 250M–300M ADA. However, no off-chain temperature check was conducted (to which the majority of the community would respond) before the on-chain vote, which led to the current NCL being approved simply to allow the budgeting process to continue.\n\nThe concept of the NCL itself is starting to feel unnecessary, as it constantly shifts based on the majority vote. If the voting stake agrees to increase or decrease the NCL, it will inevitably happen.\n\nIt’s important to emphasize that the NCL doesn’t dictate the amount that must be spent from the treasury. Every withdrawal proposal still requires approval from the community.\n\nI would likely vote YES if the current proposal fell within the 250M–300M ADA range. If a proposal like this is submitted, I would support it, as it aligns with the budget I consider reasonable based on the proposals I have endorsed.\n\nHowever, my decision isn’t final and may change depending on future developments in governance. \n\nFor instance, if governance actions combine multiple proposals that result in an excessively high total cost, or if the IOG proposal is grouped with several proposals I don’t support, or one I strongly oppose, such as the Daedalus 2025 Service Enhancement, I might reconsider my stance.\n\nIf the only way to prevent a poor budget outcome is to vote for a lower NCL, I am prepared to do so. This decision is nuanced and cannot be seen in black-and-white terms.\n\nI want to avoid a scenario where approving a lower NCL inevitably results in another GA submission. Addressing the NCL repeatedly is time-consuming and unproductive. \n\nDReps need to prioritize budget proposals instead.\n\nA higher NCL serves no purpose if it ends up funding low-quality projects within the budget.\n\nMy DRep ID:\ndrep1km69g7ksf8t5g0h9d9tkrcd2tezxelx0wtr76rv2mrkl5nzd6v3"

Setting the NCL at 200M ADA would nearly exhaust the limit, leaving little room for funding other critical infrastructure proposals. This situation risks hindering Cardano’s growth.\n\nFundamentally, the NCL is not a budget intended to be fully spent, but rather a guardrail that defines the maximum amount that may be withdrawn within a given period. As we are still in the early stages of transitioning to on-chain governance, imposing a restrictive cap at this time could undermine the flexibility needed for effective decision-making and timely response.\n\nMoreover, the NCL is not fixed permanently once established. It should be subject to review and adjustment as budget execution progresses and as market conditions evolve.\n\nIn this transitional period, it is prudent to design with sufficient margin to accommodate uncertainty. Doing so will support sustainable and strategic ecosystem governance.\n\n#Cardano #ADA #Drep"

          "text": "🔥 是時候了 🔥 我已經在 Ekklesia 上完成了對 Intersect 預算的投票。\n\n我的主要投票是基於 2 億 $ADA 的潛在 NCL 進行的。\n\n這意味著核心必需品得到資助，所剩無幾。\n\n我的主要支持用於資助 @InputOutputHK 和 @Catalyst_onX。\n\n然而，我個人的 NCL 是 2.5 億 ADA，這為 #Cardano 所需的資金留下了更多空間。\n\n如果有人提交 2.5 億的 NCL，我也會投贊成票 👀\n\n我的總支出為 247,316,767 ADA。\n\n我的完整投票歷史：\nhttps://t.co/JvcruoAc5x\n\n我的預算明細：\nhttps://t.co/5NvbG8I4k5\n\n我的 DRep ID：\ndrep1ytxr0lhg5j72wysva9ac2gsn4lck4gyen8ywxkqfchsqg3qs8uy44\n\n我其他的首選是：\n\n✅Starstream：@PaimaStudios 的下一代虛擬機 \n✅Cardano 生態系統展館在展覽會上的展出，由 @invalid_eutxo @DiscoverCardano 主辦 \n✅通過 Cardano 智能合約解鎖 BTC 流動性\n+\n✅Danogo @danogo_2023 的開源可組合智能合約審計資金 \n✅@vacuumlabs 的硬件錢包維護\n\n最後一個符合 2 億 NCL 的提案是：\n\n✅MLabs 核心工具維護與增強：@MLabs10 的 Cardano.nix\n\n對於 2.5 億 ADA 的 NCL，我認為最需要關注的提案和方面是：\n\n關鍵基礎設施 + 維護成本：\n\n有太多符合此類別的申請資金。 Midgard、#Bitcoin 集成和 Zk Rollups 是首要考慮的，但主要供應商包括：\n\n@MLabs10 @tweagio @txpipe_tools @zkFold  @AnastasiaLabs @GeniusyieldO @DripDropz_io  @cexplorer_io @ada_stat @eternlwallet @nftcdn_io  @adahandle \n\nOSC 預算提案——可持續發展的付費開源模式也應該得到資助。\n\n關鍵治理支持：\n\n1⃣ @Hornan7 的 Cardano 憲法委員會組建和 SanchoNet 教育網絡治理培訓\n\n這是繼續未來鏈上治理的必要條件。\n\n2⃣ @jrv97_velazquez 的品質保證：鏈上和鏈下審計\n\n我們需要一個獨立的資金分配審計流程，這是迄今為止最好的提案。\n\n社群行銷，而非 CF 或 Emurgo：\n\n1⃣Cardano 生態系統展館在展覽會上的展出\n2⃣Amplify Cardano：Rare Network @RareEvo 主辦的社群主導活動基金\n3⃣Amplify Cardano：Rare Network 主辦的社群主導行銷基金\n4⃣Cardano Rising：Lightning Communications 組織的日本代表團參加 Rare Evo 以促進媒體和企業影響\n5⃣Pacific Meta Inc. 的 Cardano 日本復興計畫。\n\nCF @Cardano_CF 的行銷：\n\n✅Cardano 高峰會 2025 和區域技術活動\n\nCF 有多個行銷提案，但這是我唯一認為他們最能勝任的提案。\n\n他們也有很高的要求，我相信他們應該為他們的行銷努力獲得部分補償（比如 Cardano 高峰會），但不是全部。\n\nCF 擁有 genesis ADA，他們應該將其用於改善 Cardano 社群。\n\n❌ Emurgo @emurgo_io 的任何提案均不予考慮 \n\n他們擁有大量 genesis ADA，作為 Cardano 的商業分支，他們應該用這些資金來資助行銷和商業計畫。\n\n相反，他們正在使用 genesis ADA 來否決實際 Cardano 社群成員提出的競爭性行銷提案。\n\nEmurgo / @YoroiWallet 在使用 genesis ADA 和錢包授權方面存在嚴重的利益衝突，這對他們有利。\n\n我不會支持這種公然濫用我們的治理體系和金庫資金的行為。\n\nIntersect @IntersectMBO 未能說服我他們應該獲得 1500 萬 ADA 的營運成本，所以他們也得到了否決票。\n\n總的來說，我感謝大家為實現這一目標所付出的所有努力。\n\n如果我對您的提案投了反對票，很可能是由於成本限制，該提案更適合 Catalyst，或者沒有提供足夠的資訊來證明投贊成票的合理性。\n\n我為一些提案留下了意見回饋，但由於時間限制，並非所有提案都有意見回饋。\n\n非常感謝 @adamKDean 和 @MadOrkestra 打造了 Ekklesia 🔥\n\n還要非常感謝所有使我們走到這一步的志願者和社群成員，以及所有真正關心並做出貢獻的 DReps。\n\n非常感謝！❤️",

There was generally little investment in tangible “real-world Cardano use” projects.\n\n📈【Top 5 Funded Proposals by Budget Allocation】\n\n• IOG Core Engineering: ₳96.82M (L1 Infrastructure)\n• Catalyst 2025: ₳69.46M (Governance Infrastructure)\n• Intersect: ₳20M (Organizational/Institutional Infrastructure)\n• TWEAG Proposal Series: ₳11.07M (Implementation/Haskell)\n• Cardano Summit 2025: ₳6M (Outreach & Events)\n\n※ The top 5 proposals alone represent over 60% of the total allocated budget, showing a concentration of investment.\n\n🧭【Summary of Adoption Trends】\n\nThis round’s outcomes were concentrated along two main axes, with a strong emphasis on technical infrastructure:\n\n✅ Expansion of Cardano’s technical foundation\n✅ Support for governance systems and organizational infrastructure\n\nIn contrast, proposals focusing on:\n• Real-world use cases\n• RealFi, UX, and liquidity connectivity\n• DAO-based governance\n\n• Education, culture, and media expansion\n\n…were largely passed over. Especially real-world applicability and RealFi remain key areas for potential reevaluation in future rounds.\n\n📘【Comparison to SIPO Voting】\n\nSIPO YES votes: 82 proposals\n→ Passed: 40 proposals (approx. 49%)\n\nAmong SIPO’s three pillars—“Infrastructure + Real-World Implementation + Institutional Design”:\n\n→ Infrastructure-focused proposals aligned strongly with overall DRep consensus\n→ Institutional proposals had mixed results\n→ Real-world use case proposals were mostly deferred\n\n❌【Trends Among Rejected SIPO-Supported Proposals】\n\nMany real-world use case proposals were likely seen as more suitable for Catalyst than the Treasury, due to lower short-term ROI visibility or measurable KPIs.\n\nThat said, these proposals form the conceptual foundation of a future decentralized societal OS.\n\nWe strongly encourage these projects to resubmit for Round 2 or 2026, especially as ecosystem maturity catches up with their ambition.\n\n🗳️ SIPO Voting Record:\n👇\nhttps://t.co/TdUryU1iVT\n\n📅【Upcoming Timeline】\n• Mid-May: Round 2 Ekklesia signaling opens (proposal updates allowed)\n• June: 2nd Budget Info Action → On-chain voting\n• Summer onward: Governance and budget process refinement for 2026 cycle\n\n🧭【SIPO’s Next Actions】\n• Monitor and publicly track progress of the 40 passed proposals\n• Support re-submission of rejected proposals in culture, education, and DAO areas\n• Continue publishing reports and recommendations on decentralized governance\n• Maintain focused voting on regional DAOs, real-world use, and public-good-oriented initiatives\n\nSIPO is committed not just to speaking of a decentralized future,\nbut to actively designing it—one vote at a time.\n🫡 Let’s build the chain people actually use.\n🧭 And the community that actually governs it.\n\nDRep ID:\ndrep1yffld2866p00cyg3ejjdewtvazgah7jjgk0s9m7m5ytmmdq33v3zh"

          "text": "今日凌晨 5 點的擔憂 🚨：\n目前這些是委託指標：\n112.1 億已委託\n59.8 億棄權\n52.3 億活躍投票\n39.1 億已在 Ekklesia 投票（截至目前）\n這是活躍投票權力的 74% 參與率 \n\n26.2 億是 50+1 Lovelace%，這是提案本應被強制達到的真正門檻（這應該是納入此預算資訊行動所需的票數，但我不會在這一點上使其更複雜，我們只是在激怒 DReps）\n\n我們已經給予了一些提案虛假的有效性和批准，而拖延的風險將迫使我們推進。 我們應該推動對提案進行單獨的金庫撥款，作為對不受歡迎提案的最後一道篩選程序，但根據我過去 9 個月在 Cardano 的治理經驗，我懷疑他們不會這樣做，因為他們希望盡可能多地通過。",

          "text": "隨著 Cardano 2025 年預算流程的推進，多個提案浮出水面，旨在重新評估淨變化限額 (NCL)。 以下是當前情況的概要：\n\n✅ 已批准：DReps 已正式批准 2025 年 3.5 億 ADA 的 NCL。 它基於 2024 年的金庫收入模型（約 3.36 億 ADA），現已成為當前預算審議的基礎。\n\n❌ 已否決：一項更保守的提案，即 2025 年上限為 3 億 ADA，2026 年上限為 2.5 億 ADA，未獲批准。\n\n🟠 審查中：\n「2025 Cardano NCL」提議將 NCL 降至 2 億 ADA，敦促在去中心化金庫治理的第一年採取謹慎態度。\n「Epochs 563–635 期間 3 億 ADA」旨在為 2026 年初設立 NCL，支持跨重疊時期的預算連續性。\n\n與此同時，已提交了若干新的資金提案：\n\n1⃣ 750 萬 ADA 用於社群建設者提案——僅包括獲得 ≥2.69B ADA 支持的提案，不包括 Intersect 和創始實體的提案。\n\n2⃣ 150 萬 ADA 用於 Amaru Rust 節點開發——這是一項由 PRAGMA 領導的倡議，旨在實現 Cardano 節點多樣化並增強網路彈性。\n\n3⃣ 5000 萬 ADA 用於 DeFi 流動性——旨在為 DEX 和穩定幣注入流動性，部分收益將返還給金庫。\n\n作為 SIPO DRep，我們基於以下因素評估這些進展：\n\n🔍 審慎治理：支持 2 億 ADA 的 NCL。\n🚀 增長與勢頭：支持維持 3.5 億 ADA 的上限。\n⚖️ 平衡妥協：3 億 ADA 可能是一個務實的折衷方案。\n\n對於資金提案，我們的評估將側重於：\n它是否能為金庫帶來回報？\n透明度和執行能力是否得到保證？\n它是否為去中心化金融治理的第一年樹立了強而有力的先例？\n\nNCL 不僅僅是一個數字——它反映了 Cardano 的金融理念和增長軌跡。 改變上限直接影響哪些提案是可行的。\n\n我們將很快發布 SIPO 對每個主要提案的評估標準和投票邏輯。 在此期間，我們歡迎您在投票開始前提出意見。\n\n如果您支持我們作為 DRep 的工作，請考慮委託：\n\nDRep ID：\ndrep1yffld2866p00cyg3ejjdewtvazgah7jjgk0s9m7m5ytmmdq33v3zh\n\n對於 Daedalus：\ndrep120m237kstm7pzywv5nwtjm8gj8dl55j9nupwlkapz77mgv7zu7l",

Here’s a breakdown of the current situation:\n\n✅ Approved: The 2025 NCL of 350M ADA has been formally ratified by DReps. It’s based on a 2024 treasury income model (approx. 336M ADA) and now serves as the foundation for current budget deliberations.\n\n❌ Rejected: A more conservative proposal to cap 2025 at 300M ADA and 2026 at 250M ADA was not approved.\n\n🟠 Under Review:\n“2025 Cardano NCL” proposes lowering the NCL to 200M ADA, urging a cautious approach during this first year of decentralized treasury governance.\n“300M ADA for Epochs 563–635” aims to establish an NCL for early 2026, supporting budget continuity across overlapping periods.\n\nMeanwhile, several new funding proposals have been submitted:\n\n1⃣ 7.5M ADA for Community Builder Proposals — includes only those with ≥2.69B ADA support, excluding proposals from Intersect and founding entities.\n\n2⃣ 1.5M ADA for Amaru Rust Node Development — a PRAGMA-led initiative to diversify Cardano nodes and enhance network resilience.\n\n3⃣ 50M ADA for DeFi Liquidity — aims to seed liquidity into DEXs and stablecoins, with yield partially returned to the treasury.\n\nAs SIPO DRep, we’re evaluating these developments based on:\n\n🔍 Cautious governance: supports the 200M ADA NCL.\n🚀 Growth & momentum: supports maintaining the 350M ADA cap.\n⚖️ Balanced compromise: 300M ADA could be a pragmatic middle ground.\n\nFor funding proposals, our assessment will focus on:\nDoes it generate a return to the treasury?\nIs transparency and execution capacity ensured?\nDoes it set a strong precedent for the first year of decentralized financial governance?\n\nThe NCL is more than just a number — it reflects Cardano’s financial philosophy and growth trajectory. Changing the cap directly impacts which proposals are viable.\n\nWe’ll soon publish SIPO’s evaluation criteria and vote logic for each major proposal. In the meantime, we welcome your input before the voting begins.\n\nIf you support our work as a DRep, please consider delegating:\n\nDRep ID:\ndrep1yffld2866p00cyg3ejjdewtvazgah7jjgk0s9m7m5ytmmdq33v3zh\n\nFor Daedalus:\ndrep120m237kstm7pzywv5nwtjm8gj8dl55j9nupwlkapz77mgv7zu7l"

Instead, they are invited to submit their own governance actions for budget requests.\n\nI fully support this decision, as it aligns with the ongoing community debate about the Net Change Limit (NCL).\n\nThe current NCL is set at 350M ADA, but a reduction is expected. Two governance actions have been submitted to adjust the NCL to 200M or 300M ADA.\n\nTo minimize spending, it’s best to decide on-chain for each proposal individually, rather than bundling multiple proposals into a single governance action.\n\nThis approach prevents situations where DReps who support IOG’s budget feel obligated to also back community proposals they disagree with.\n\nGiven the circumstances, Intersect has made the right decision, and I appreciate their approach."

          "abstract": "The goal of this proposal is to increase liquidity on Cardano, specifically by supporting stablecoin liquidity. 50,000,000 ADA is requested over the course of 12 months (the duration of the budget) to support the Cardano decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. The majority of the funds in this budget will be disbursed to DeFi protocols including decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and lending protocols to help seed liquidity on Cardano. The funds are managed by a 7 person administrating committee composed of publicly identified individuals who are part of multi-signature (multisig) wallet from which liquidity will be managed. This budget is proposed independent of other efforts since the goal of this budget is not to pay developers or companies for ecosystem improvements, rather to increase liquidity in the system overall. Further, unlike other proposals this budget serves as a revenue stream for the Cardano treasury since yields from DeFi protocols will be sent back to the Cardano treasury.",
          "rationale": "### Constitutionality of the Budget\n\n**Purpose**: This proposal is for work intended to enhance the long term sustainability of Cardano by increasing stablecoin liquidity in the ecosystem.\n\n**Article III(5)**: This proposal fulfills this section of the Cardano Constitution by containing a Title, Abstract, Reason for Proposal (Motivation and Rationale), and Supporting Materials. An off-chain copy of this proposal can be found at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theeldermillenial/2025-liquidity-budget/refs/heads/master/info.jsonld, and the document hash is attached to the transaction to fulfill the other requirements of this section. An easy to read version can be found at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theeldermillenial/2025-liquidity-budget/refs/heads/master/README.md\n\n**Article IV(1)**: We propose that this budget span 73 epochs (roughly 1 calendar year).\n\n**Article IV(2)**: Disbursements for this budget must be made to a multi-signature (multisig) wallet composed of at least seven independent administrating members with at 4 of 7 signing policy. The process of overseeing funds then requires 4 of the 7 independent administrating members agree to disbursement of funds to DeFi protocols. The wallet must be the owner of any liquidity deposited into DeFi protocols, meaning liquidity tokens or any other assurance of liquidity must be held in the multisig wallet and should not be delegated to a third party, except as required for conversion of assets to fiat or minting of stablecoins. With this design, the committee will be the administrator of the budget funds and will directly oversee distribution of funds to protocols.\n\n**Article IV(3)**: At the time of submission, the NCL is currently at 350 million ADA and there is only one budget requesting 1.5 million ADA that has been submitted on chain through an info action. We believe that this removes a potential constitutional barrier for this proposal based on Article IV(3), since this proposal requests 50 million ADA of the potential remaining 348.5 million ADA.\n\n**Article IV(4)**: We budget 2,000 ADA/month (24,000 ADA total) to cover the costs of audits and transparency. The building of a dashboard and quarterly reporting in the proposed work also fulfill the obligations of this section. Since all funds will be managed from a single account, including all liquidity holdings and disbursement of monthly stipends for administrating committee members, we believe the dashboard and monthly reports are sufficient for auditing. To further strengthen our commitment to the auditing requirement, we also commit to any community driven requests for independent audits via an Info Action, and will use funds up to the $50,000/month budget to work with an independent auditor.\n\n**Article IV(5)**: The nature of the proposed work fulfills the first requirement of Article IV(5) of the constitution. The holding of all assets in the multisig account composed of 7 independent signers improves the ability of the Cardano community to easily audit and track actions taken by the committee. To fulfill the second part of the section, funds will not be delegated to an SPO and will be delegated to the predefined auto-abstain voting option.\n\n**TREASURY-04a**: There is not on chain withdrawal action for this budget, and one will not be submitted unless this budget achieves the necessary 50% approval.",

The committee should make every effort to help mitigate the potential price impact of converting ADA to fiat to mint as stable coins over the 12 month period. Note that up to 35% of funds may be held in ADA to pair with ADA/Stablecoin pairs on DEXs, which will help to alleviate price impact concerns.\n* **Administration** - A 7 person administrating committee will manage the treasury reserve using a multisig wallet (4 of 7 signature validation) to hold and deploy funds to protocols. The administrating committee will be responsible for working with stablecoin issuers to convert ADA to fiat backed stablecoins and deploying liquidity. A specific focus of the administrating committee will be analyzing approaches of deploying ADA to stablecoins in a way that minimizes ADA price impact.\n* **Revenue** - Deployed funds will increase in value according to the interest and fees defined by the protocols fees are disbursed to. Each month the total interest generated by the deployed liquidity will be calculated and 15% of accumulated interest from protocols will be withdrawn from the respective protocols and sent back to the treasury, while the remaining 85% of accumulated interest will remain in the protocol (e.g. analagous but not identical to compounding interest). ADA held by the committee that is not deployed will not be staked according to constitutional requirements (see Rationale for more information).\n* **Deployment** - DeFi protocols with at least 250,000 ADA worth of a stablecoin may apply to be recipients of minted stablecoin, and the administrating committee will review and disburse funds to protocols that have the best plans for growth and returns back to the treasury. A maximum of 2 or 3 protocols may be used per DeFi category to help minimize fragmentation. Applicants should make a strong case for the use of their protocol, including a a description of historical success, security, dedicated support for handling issues, and features of the protocol that will maximize the value to the Cardano treasury if liquidity is deployed to the protocol. New protocols will not be excluded for having limited history, but must make a strong case in other areas of the application.\n* **Strategy** - The committee will deploy funds on a monthly basis in a way that minimizes ADA price impact and fees. A specific focus should be on deployment of liquidity that can be \"passively\" managed, meaning frequent adjustements are not needed. The focus on passive management is to help ease the management strategy and reduce the fees incurred by managing liquidity. This may be changed in the future by an on chain Info Action.\n* **Audits and Transparency** - The committee is responsible for creating a monthly report or building a dashboard (or both) to describe the ADA held in reserve, the funds deployed to protocols, and all fees and other costs associated with managing the treasury. The committee may use part of the monthly budget to develop a dashboard to provide live updates of the stablecoin reserve for the Cardano community.\n* **Costs** - Each member of the committee will be compensated $2,000/month in the fiat backed stablecoin of their choice ($14,000/month total for all committee members). The stablecoin reserve fund will cover the costs of minting fiat backed stables, deployment of liquidity to protocols, and rebalancing if needed. The committe will also use some funds to perform KYB/KYC of 3rd parties as needed as well as cover costs for creation of a legal entity to house the fund. Total costs per month should be capped at $50,000/month over the 12 month period. Any costs that extend beyond the budget period should be deducted from the accrued interest.\n* **Organization** - Part of the initial budget will be used to investigate proper incorporation of a legal entity to house the funds being managed for this budget. Every reasonable attempt should be made to house the fund in a non-profit to maximize tax benefits as well as provide future opportunities for organizations to donate to the fund.\n* **Revisions** - Since this fund may exist in perpetuity due to funds not being directly spent, it is important to have a mechanism for modification up to and including returning all funds back to the treasury. To this end, any member of the Cardano community may submit an Info Action to modify any aspect of this budget including members of the committee, monthly budget limits, committee pay, and returning some or all of funds back to the treasury. All members of the committee must commit to following any on chain Info Action that is passed by 67% of the community vote. If a committee member does not feel they can continue with their duties at any time, they must continue to carry out their duties until a suitable replacement is found according to the impeachment and replacement mechanisms described below.\n\n### Governing Committee\n\n#### Term Limits\n\nCommunity members have a maximum term limit of 2 years, after which they can re-apply for a second 2 year term. A minimum of 4 community members (not affiliated with founding entities) must be on the committee at all times.\n\nFounding entities may have at most 1 person each on the committee. There are no term limits for committee members that represent a founding entity, but must still abide by the removal process of an Info Action or a majority vote of the other committee members.\n\n#### Retirement and Impeachment\n\nIn the event that a committee member retires or their signing keys are exposed, the remaining members of the committee must create a new multisig address with the same policy (4 of 7) that removes the retired address. This process also gives the committee the capacity to impeach inactive members of the committee, as well as the ability for the community to impeach one or more members through an info action.\n\n#### Community Feedback\n\nThe administrating committee members should make themselves available to feedback and questions from the Cardano community, and make attempts to make changes that incorporate reasonable feedback from the community. Feedback can be received through a Telegram channel, on Twitter, scheduled town hall meetings not more than once per month. The administrating committee should make attempts to incorporate feedback from the Cardano community, but are not obligated to do so. If the administrating committee does not respond or refuses to incorporate changes, the Cardano community may submit an on chain Info Action (that achieves 67% approval) to compel the committee to make changes up to and including removal of one or more members and/or returning some or all funds back to the treasury.\n\n#### People\n\nBelow are 6 of the 7 members of the initial administrating committee. They range in experience and background to help ensure the long term success and sustainability of the stablecoin liquidity. There is an ongoing search for a 7th member of the committee and will be included in the withdrawal action.\n\n1.

        "abstract": "The goal of this proposal is to increase liquidity on Cardano, specifically by supporting stablecoin liquidity. 50,000,000 ADA is requested over the course of 12 months (the duration of the budget) to support the Cardano decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. The majority of the funds in this budget will be disbursed to DeFi protocols including decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and lending protocols to help seed liquidity on Cardano. The funds are managed by a 7 person administrating committee composed of publicly identified individuals who are part of multi-signature (multisig) wallet from which liquidity will be managed. This budget is proposed independent of other efforts since the goal of this budget is not to pay developers or companies for ecosystem improvements, rather to increase liquidity in the system overall. Further, unlike other proposals this budget serves as a revenue stream for the Cardano treasury since yields from DeFi protocols will be sent back to the Cardano treasury.",

        "rationale": "### Constitutionality of the Budget\n\n**Purpose**: This proposal is for work intended to enhance the long term sustainability of Cardano by increasing stablecoin liquidity in the ecosystem.\n\n**Article III(5)**: This proposal fulfills this section of the Cardano Constitution by containing a Title, Abstract, Reason for Proposal (Motivation and Rationale), and Supporting Materials. An off-chain copy of this proposal can be found at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theeldermillenial/2025-liquidity-budget/refs/heads/master/info.jsonld, and the document hash is attached to the transaction to fulfill the other requirements of this section. An easy to read version can be found at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theeldermillenial/2025-liquidity-budget/refs/heads/master/README.md\n\n**Article IV(1)**: We propose that this budget span 73 epochs (roughly 1 calendar year).\n\n**Article IV(2)**: Disbursements for this budget must be made to a multi-signature (multisig) wallet composed of at least seven independent administrating members with at 4 of 7 signing policy. The process of overseeing funds then requires 4 of the 7 independent administrating members agree to disbursement of funds to DeFi protocols. The wallet must be the owner of any liquidity deposited into DeFi protocols, meaning liquidity tokens or any other assurance of liquidity must be held in the multisig wallet and should not be delegated to a third party, except as required for conversion of assets to fiat or minting of stablecoins. With this design, the committee will be the administrator of the budget funds and will directly oversee distribution of funds to protocols.\n\n**Article IV(3)**: At the time of submission, the NCL is currently at 350 million ADA and there is only one budget requesting 1.5 million ADA that has been submitted on chain through an info action. We believe that this removes a potential constitutional barrier for this proposal based on Article IV(3), since this proposal requests 50 million ADA of the potential remaining 348.5 million ADA.\n\n**Article IV(4)**: We budget 2,000 ADA/month (24,000 ADA total) to cover the costs of audits and transparency. The building of a dashboard and quarterly reporting in the proposed work also fulfill the obligations of this section. Since all funds will be managed from a single account, including all liquidity holdings and disbursement of monthly stipends for administrating committee members, we believe the dashboard and monthly reports are sufficient for auditing. To further strengthen our commitment to the auditing requirement, we also commit to any community driven requests for independent audits via an Info Action, and will use funds up to the $50,000/month budget to work with an independent auditor.\n\n**Article IV(5)**: The nature of the proposed work fulfills the first requirement of Article IV(5) of the constitution. The holding of all assets in the multisig account composed of 7 independent signers improves the ability of the Cardano community to easily audit and track actions taken by the committee. To fulfill the second part of the section, funds will not be delegated to an SPO and will be delegated to the predefined auto-abstain voting option.\n\n**TREASURY-04a**: There is not on chain withdrawal action for this budget, and one will not be submitted unless this budget achieves the necessary 50% approval.",

        "summary": "「Cardano 國庫 DeFi 流動性預算」提案請求從 Cardano 國庫撥款5000萬 ADA，為期12個月，主要目標是增加 Cardano DeFi 生態系統內的流動性，特別是穩定幣的流動性。該提案將由一個7人委員會透過多簽錢包進行管理。一個關鍵特徵是其旨在透過這些 DeFi 活動產生收益，並將一部分（15%）按月返還給國庫。提出此倡議的背景是 Cardano 需要提升其 DeFi 板塊的總鎖倉價值（TVL）和整體活躍度以保持競爭力 。提案聲稱其符合憲法規定，並詳細說明了資金部署、收入分享、成本管理和委員會治理的機制。",
        "myOpinion": "我反對當前版本的「Cardano 國庫 DeFi 流動性預算」提案。雖然增強 Cardano DeFi 流動性的戰略目標  對其競爭力和生態系統發展至關重要，但這5000萬 ADA 的請求數額巨大，而目前的提案（如回饋推文所示）在透明度、營運細節和健全的治理監督機制方面存在關鍵缺陷。DRep 們提出的關於決策過程模糊、穩定幣選擇策略、做市商參與以及防止價值流失（例如，國庫資金被協議收取費用）機制的擔憂非常重要。此外，大規模轉換可能對 ADA 價格造成負面影響的風險 需要比目前概述的更具體的緩解策略。一個更審慎的方法是，先進行一個規模較小、細節明確的試點計畫，或者透過資訊行動讓社群和 DRep 共同完善營運框架，以確保問責制並最大化 Cardano 的長期戰略利益。為優秀的工程和穩健的財務管理支付溢價，意味著如此大規模的國庫部署必須經過精心策劃和透明治理，以確保可持續性和真正的生態系統增強。"

          "originalText": "Okay #Cardano Community, let's chat about the budget. I want to address two key fundamental issues that must be addressed before any meaningful conversation about amounts can be had. \n\n1. Who/what entity is the custodian of the funds.\n&\n2. Lump Sums  vs Tranches - Dissemination of Funds\n\n-----\nFirst off: let me say that I think this would make for a GREAT Space Place/Twitter Space convo (@adosiawolf ). \n\nOkay, so - who should be the custodian of the funds? Many people have argued for incremental releases of the funds as certain metrics are met. Here is where I think we need to first focus: \n\nAnnual Budget is ≠ to Catalyst. \n\nCatalyst acts as an incubator for startups. Annual budget does not (currently). Where as each individual proposal can be voted on via catalyst, we should not expect that same thing to translate to the annual budget. It is not the job of every $ADA holder to audit/hold accountable/track the progress of everything that is in the annual budget. We HAVE to delegate that responsibility to specific groups (working groups/committees/whatever flavor of group you'd like to insert). This is the only scalable way for something as large as a global ecosystem to function. Now, if the group of people tasked with overseeing their particular portion of the budget do a bad job, then the community should hold them accountable and vote them out/replace. The community's role is to vote for the group that oversees and keep them accountable, not to be giving marching orders down in the granular aspects of each line item of the budget. We have already seen what poor interaction Catalyst has due to the sheer amount of info. Why would this be any different for annual operating budget? So - does it require a certain amount of trust in the individuals who are overseeing that particular section of the budget? YES. Is that antithetical to blockchain? IMO, NO. We check and balance the people, not the granular. If you don't like how they choose to spend that portion of the budget, then vote them out for people who are more aligned with how you would like to see the funds spent. \n\nCadence/Distribution of funds: if we hold the above information to be the modus operandi, then this answers itself. You can't run payroll waiting on a new tranche of money each month. You have to have cash on hand. @IOHK_Charles made a great point last night in reference to contracts and deals and anyone who has done business understands this. I won't be the preverbal dead horse, but again, if the budget ≠ to catalyst, then tranches are out of the question. Lump sum to each area to execute on their respective budget area. \n\nThis is just to get the convo started. \nsummoning @RichardMcCrackn @radioastro @bigpeyYT @cryptorecruitr @hoskytoken @CardanoNoodz @KaizenCrypto  for exposure on the convo."

          "originalText": "I've taken the time to review the #Cardano 2025 budget materials, and here is my take 🔥\n\n1⃣ 300 - 500 Million $ADA is too much of an ask for any entity for the 2025 budget. \n\nEven if this amount of ADA is not sold all at once, opening up ~500 million ADA to be sold will have negative price implications on announcement alone.\n\nThis would harm all ADA holders and builders financially, which I am not willing to support.\n\n2⃣ Estimated treasury income for 2025 will be ~334 Million ADA, so we should not spend more than this.\n\nIf we want to do better than fiat governments, we should run a surplus not a deficit.\n\n3⃣ I am fully on board for an annual budget, it works better for the business world.\n\nAny long term contracts are totally possible as long as we are prioritizing what is most important to fund and working within our annual budget.\n\n4⃣ There will be a need to convert ADA to stable coins and to hedge risk for payouts. \n\nIntersect will be hedging risk and converting ADA based on monthly expenses, which is a good bar to measure by.\n\n@IntersectMBO  is currently set up to be the facilitator of the budget by IOG + the CF, and will be the group auditing and holding projects accountable.\n\nThere is a process already defined on how they will do this, which is great and includes quarterly reviews and milestones:\n\nhttps://t.co/MeysCdOhmy\n\nThere is an independent 3rd party entity, the Cardano Development Foundation (CDF) established in the Cayman Islands that holds the ADA and distributes it to Intersect (sole administrator and facilitator of CDF). \n\nThe CDF has a mandate to work for the betterment of the Cardano Community, so this is how the ADA will be protected.\n\n5⃣ Independent treasury withdraw requests outside of Intersect or the budget are entirely possible pending Constitutional Committee and DRep votes.\n\nIf something big comes up that requires funding it is still possible to request funds, so we should account for this outside of the @IntersectCBC budget.\n\n6⃣ Intersect ADA should not be staked, and this should be a condition of budget approval. \n\nThis will drain the treasury further, taking funds that are not approved in the budget. \n\nIf a staking initiative is created and applies for funding and gets approved, that is something different that should be considered under its own merits, critiques, and votes.\n\nIf there is an interest in furthering decentralization (which means supporting single pool operators), then there are many other actions that can be taken by Intersect, DReps, and CC members, like increasing K = 1000 or through the @Cardano_CF  staking program.\n\n7⃣ Intersect ADA should not be used to vote, and this should be a condition of budget approval. \n\nThis unbalances the ecosystem in a large and biased favor.\n\nIntersect does not intend to do this, but they have also stated they are beholden to Intersect members specifically, not all ADA holders.\n\nThis means if Intersect members vote for using Intersect ADA to vote, it is a possibility.\n\n🚀Based on everything that has been presented by both Intersect and Charles @IOHK_Charles , below is my recommended budget for Cardano 2025:\n\n- Intersect gets 50% of the projected treasury income for 2025 (which is a much less risky ask).\n- 25% is available for alternative spend requests (which are more cumbersome).\n- 25% goes into savings for the future.\n\nThis is of course flexible, but a much better starting point in my opinion. \n\nIf Catalyst @Catalyst_onX is included in the intersect buckets, then more ADA from the \"Extra\" category could be allocated to give Catalyst more funding. \n\nIt is unclear if Catalyst will fall under this or not, and this detail should be clear prior to budget approval - do you know @dannyribar @CatalystSwarm @radioastro ?\n\nIf Intersect needs more ADA than this, there should be a more detailed budget breakdown on their part as to why this extra ADA is needed, and where it is to be allocated.\n\nAll my numbers and docs publicly available 👇\nhttps://t.co/hTuuqbACBx\n\nCollected Intersect Materials available thanks to @ElCryptonaut 👇\nhttps://t.co/Tc6Fb1E5wY\n\nHighlight of Charles' AMA video 👇\nhttps://t.co/kufSlz1Nx0\n\nAnd full Video 👇\nhttps://t.co/ScYNHXHtVZ\n\nSee part 2 for more 🧵"

          "originalText": "A few observations about the Cardano budget.\n\nI am pleased with the total budget of 266.7M ADA. I expect revenue to be higher (about 320M ADA), so we will likely save ADA for the next few years.\n\nBeing in a bull market, it is advantageous to invest more for several reasons. \n\nAs the market price of ADA increases, getting a higher dollar value with a smaller amount of ADA coins becomes possible. \n\nAdditionally, smart investments can attract new users to the ecosystem. Let's expect that user activity will decline in the middle of 2026. \n\nThe likely reason for allocating only 60M ADA to the next three Catalyst Funds (20M for each fund) is the higher market price of ADA.\n\nWhat I find missing in the budget are investments in DeFi and the minting of stablecoins. \n\nI envision minting 1-2M stablecoins each epoch, such as USDM and DJED. The cost would be around 140M USD, which translates to about 140M ADA if the average price of ADA throughout the bull market is 1 USD. \n\nHowever, if the average price of ADA were higher, say 2 USD, the cost in the ADA value would be half as much. The budget calculates that 1 ADA is 0.5 USD. That doesn't seem adequate to me.\n\nThis is a topic we should discuss and consider.\n\nCan the current budget be reduced? Can we allocate ADA differently?\n\nI don’t want to criticize the high costs line by line without knowing all the details. I’ll use common sense. \n\nFeel free to correct me or provide important context.\n\nOn-chain governance seems excessively expensive to me. While DReps can vote on governance actions, Intersect and various committees will cost us tens of millions of ADA. \n\nWith such a high budget, we risk depleting a significant amount of ADA in the treasury during the next bear market.\n\nThe costs of the Budget Committee also seem high. Some processes could be more cost-effective. Do we really need a Budget Summit? DReps can meet at the Cardano Summit (see below).\n\nAllocating 20M ADA for IntersectMBO seems like a lot. \n\nWhen I looked at the individual items, the total was 2.7M ADA. Perhaps I am misunderstanding something.\n\nRegarding the Product Committee category, the costs appear high, especially for items that we may not need or that I believe were already ready.\n\nIf I'm not mistaken, the multi-resource consensus Minotaur is being built for Midnight, not Cardano. The same applies to Proof of Useful Work.\n\nI would like to focus primarily on scalability, ZK technology, L2s, and other technologies that Cardano needs as soon as possible. Some items in the budget can wait.\n\nI would like to see a budget linked to the roadmap. We need the strategy first. Then make the roadmap and link it with the budget.\n\nThe largest costs in the budget relate to the Technical Steering Committee. Core Maintenance will cost us 40M ADA. This seems like a huge expense and is worth investigating in more detail.\n\nIn the 80M ADA allocated for the Membership & Community Committee, 60M ADA is for three Catalyst Funds. This leaves us with 20M ADA to discuss. \n\nI have never heard of Community Hubs. I know there were proposals to create various hubs in Catalyst, and some were funded. Do we really need to invest 3.2M ADA in the Community Hub?\n\n11.2M ADA is allocated for The Civic Committee. This includes compensation for committee members and DReps. \n\n1.8M ADA is allocated for DReps, which is roughly 0.5% of the total budget. While the prevailing opinion is that DReps should work for free, I believe using 0.5% of the budget for their rewards is reasonable. DReps and committee members deserve some compensation.\n\nDReps decide on the budget. They can save ADA or better direct the budget.\n\nA topic worth discussing is whether DReps should be more involved in internal processes. DReps are elected by the community, and if they are interested, they should be members of committees and participate in tasks like compiling the budget. \n\nPerhaps only those DReps who are more involved in these processes should be paid.\n\nI would halve the 20M ADA allocated for the Growth & Marketing Committee. Cardano needs to invest in technology, not marketing. I more or less agree with the items in the Growth section.\n\n3.1M ADA is the cost for Cardano Summit 2026. I would agree with that and link it directly to other meetings, such as the DReps meeting and the debate on the next budget.\n\nI would definitely not pay influencers. I don't believe this type of marketing works.\n\nI approve of 3.8M ADA for the Open Source Committee and would gladly increase the budget if possible, provided we save money elsewhere.\n\nDespite my reservations about the budget and my efforts to reduce some costs, I might be willing to approve the budget. I'm not sure yet. I would like to see some changes.\n\nThe budget will still change based on community input, so please comment on the Cardano Forum.\n\nMy opinion is that we should save on marketing, maybe on Community Hubs, development of technologies that Cardano does not need in the next 2 years, and other items and rather mint stablecoins.\n\nEveryone will have a different opinion on the budget. It will be difficult to find consensus in a decentralized environment. Therefore, I will tend to approve the budget unless I find a fundamental problem. I will continue to examine the budget and comment on it if needed.\n\nI am curious about the final version."

I support the idea but I think it needs some amendments providing more details and specifications before I can vote for it as a treasury withdrawal motion. Here's the feedback I left on your proposal on https://t.co/xCm5Kkm0f2\n\n\"While I am in favor of supplying stablecoin liquidity from the treasury (you definately convinced me on that score), I don't think this proposal is complete enough to qualify as a proper treasury expenditure proposal yet. I think this should be an info-action proposal because it is TOO VAGUE. \n\nThis proposal does not define several key elements such what % of the 50M ADA will be minted into which stablecoins? (50% USDM, 50% USDA? 33% iUSD, 33% USDA, 33% USDM?) It also does not specify what market maker(s) is proposed to execute the liquidity provision. It also does not account for how much and how the oversight committee and the market maker will be compensated for their services. How much of this 50M proposed expenditure can we expect will actually end up as stablecoins in Cardano? Similarly, The proposal specifies \"guidelines\" and \"legal agreements\" that the market maker must follow, but it does not go into any detail about them. All of the above could be overlooked if the proposal specified WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING THOSE DECISIONS. Unfortunately, it does not. \n\nFor actions like this the outcome often depends on the details, and we have no details to evaluate or an administrative team to whose competency we can vet. For all the good arguments and suggestions in this proposal, it doesn't explain itself thoroughly enough to win my vote as a formal treasury withdrawal motion. I would vote for it as an info action. WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT THE DETAILS ARE, OR WHO WILL MAKE THOSE DECISIONS.\""

          "originalText": "As a DRep, I have decided to vote YES on the governance action regarding the setting of the Net Change Limit (NCL). ✅🫡\n\nRead my rationale:\n\nThe Governance Action (GA) proposes an NCL of 300M ADA for 2025 and 250M ADA for 2026.\n\nIt is crucial that the NCL does not exceed the expected revenues of the Treasury. A prudent economist aims to ensure expenses remain below revenues while also building reserves for the future.\n\nPersonally, I would prefer an NCL of 280M ADA for 2025 and 230M ADA for 2026. That said, I recognize that during a bull market, we can afford to allocate more funds—potentially even using Treasury resources to buy stablecoins.\n\nFor Cardano to thrive, it must remain in the top 10 blockchain platforms in the coming years and stay competitive. Achieving this requires consistent investment, particularly in scalability.\n\nFrom a long-term perspective, Cardano must also prepare for resistance against quantum computers. This will demand significant investment over the next decade, which needs to be factored into current planning.\n\nThe Intersect budget is estimated at 260M ADA—lower than the proposed NCL. I believe this budget can be reduced; however, even if it isn't, it will remain within the limits set by this GA. Therefore, the NCL will not hinder ecosystem funding.\n\nI propose utilizing the Treasury to mint stablecoins within the Cardano ecosystem, which could generate yield and serve as an additional revenue stream. At present, ADA fee revenue does not meet expectations, and diversifying income sources is critical.\n\nYield generation could also be redistributed as staking rewards. If ADA could capture the success of the Cardano ecosystem, it could have a positive impact on the market capitalization.\n\nThese are the reasons I advocate for setting the NCL above the Intersect budget.\n\nHowever, I do acknowledge the risks. If a new NCL is not approved for 2027, the last approved NCL—250M ADA—will remain in effect. This could result in spending exceeding Treasury income that year. Nevertheless, I am confident the community will successfully ratify a new NCL when the time comes.\n\nIn my opinion, the NCL should be calculated as a percentage of Treasury income from the previous year. \n\nFor instance, if Treasury income totaled 300M ADA during the last 73 epochs and the NCL was set at 90%, the spending limit would be 270M ADA.\n\nImportant monetary parameters are currently defined as percentages, and it would be wise to maintain this convention. Additionally, such a mechanism could provide stability and predictability over multiple years without requiring frequent adjustments.\n\nAs the GA indicates, the method of setting the NCL can always be revised. I do not intend to promote my own perspective by rejecting other Governance Actions.\n\nI appreciate that this GA originates from the community rather than from founding entities. It is encouraging to see the community assuming greater responsibility.\n\nThe proposed NCLs for the next two years are reasonable and align with long-term sustainability. It is crucial not to delay investments in ecosystem development. The sooner we approve the NCL, the better.\n\nDisclaimer: If an alternative GA proposing a different NCL emerges and aligns more closely with my views, I may reconsider my vote. It makes sense to support only one proposal.\n\nMy DRep ID:\ndrep1km69g7ksf8t5g0h9d9tkrcd2tezxelx0wtr76rv2mrkl5nzd6v3"

          "originalText": "Early voting Intention announcement on: \"2025 Net Change Limit\" governance info action: ❌\n\n🚨If you are delegating to me, please redelegate to someone who wants to vote YES or ABSTAIN 🚨\n\nI welcome the proposed Net Change Limit proposal. The proposers have stated that from January 5th, 2024, Epoch 459, through December 30th, Epoch 531, the actual total income into the Cardano Treasury was 335,957,093 ada.\n\nThe proposed NCL is 350M ada. This is roughly 14M ada higher than the total income in the Cardano Treasury for 2024. I welcome the proposed reference to modelling and the reference to a previous period for which we have data. \n\nThe motion uses modelling of ADA inflow for the previous year as the main basis for approving an NCL. It is indeed one of the factors that must be considered.\n \nWhat I am missing in this proposal - as it proposes a relatively large NCL - is even a minor economic analysis of how approvals of different NCLs could impact the valuation of ADA. An NCL of 350M ADA is sending a signal to the market. What is this signal? \n\nHow does it compare to previous signals? If we do not have the data, is there room for a prediction at least?\nWith the lack of this economic/monetary analysis, we are left to speculate. My feeling is that NCL approvals in the future will become defining moments that shape the ADA exchange rate vs the USD. It is a signal how much ADA could be released - a signal approved by the majority of DReps. \n\nThe approval of a large NCL could have an immediate price impact on the value of ADA, thus diminishing the purchase power of the 350M ADA. Before the budget elements are approved. \n\nAfter approving a large NCL, the budgetary discussions will probably take place in the shadow of a lower ADA/USD exchange rate. Thus we might be forced by the market to push an annual budget towards the top limit of the NCL. We could create a self-fulfilling prophesy. \n\nThe problem I see with a very large first year NCL is that our budgetary and governance processes are the weakest and most inefficient in the first year. Our ability to audit, prevent waste and abuse are questionable. A lower NCL would focus minds.\n\nWithout a monetary/economic analysis or forecast, I would consider voting for a NCL in the 200-250M ADA in 2025 (depending on the text of the NCL proposal) as it would give a better signal to the market about our intentions to balance the development of the system and the intention to safeguard the value of ADA and Cardano's Top 10 position. Especially, as our abilities to manage the potential spending of so much ADA in the early days of decentralized governance are the lowest. \n\nI see this conservative approach as something that protects the interests of ADA holders and stakers. \n\nBest practice: We SHOULD approve the closest NCL to the actual budget that we want as DReps. By approving a much larger NCL we will be devaluing the ada currency BEFORE any budget is approved and before the contractors receive the ADA. Effectively crippling ourselves unnecessarily. \n\nIf the intention is to approve a lower budget than 350M ada as some (many?) DReps seem to have indicated, then to preserve the value of that ada for those who will receive it, the best thing we can do is to vote for an NCL that is closest to that intended 2025 budget total."

          "text": "我的預算提案理由\n\n我支持了23個計畫，總計2.222億 ADA。我對所有其他計畫都投了反對票。\n\n各類別支持的計畫數量：\n\n• 核心：17\n• 研究：2\n• 行銷與創新：2\n• 治理支持：2\n\n我支持的3個最大計畫是 IOG 核心開發、IO 研究和 Catalyst。\n\n這3個計畫佔了1.93億 ADA。\n\n我曾猶豫是否支持 IOG 研究。過去發表了許多學術論文。我們明年的研究計畫清單並非都需要。現在有必要更多地支持實施和生態系統，在我看來，這方面落後於研究。\n\n另一方面，Cardano 的成功在很大程度上基於研究和使用形式化方法的高品質實施。\n\n不支持研究將是一個倒退。清單上的一些東西將來可能會實施。\n\n我下次的建議是為每個計畫創建單獨的提案，而不是一個包含許多計畫的提案。這也適用於核心開發。\n\n正如我之前提到的，我認為 Catalyst 是大多數計畫應該申請資金的地方。所以我支持它。\n\n在審查預算提案期間，我注意到在許多情況下，只有大約2-3名 DReps 投票。在最好的情況下，大約10名，很少有20名左右。這是一個非常低的參與率。\n\nCatalyst 並不完美，但它已經改進了好幾年，團隊經驗豐富，而且它是一個經過實戰檢驗的工具。ADA 持有者已經熟悉該系統。此外，還計畫進行進一步的改進。\n\n目前，我認為沒有理由用預算提案取代 Catalyst。\n\n我的另一個建議是，一旦 NCL 獲得批准，IOG 應該為其提案提交單獨的 GA。這將避免 DReps 在一個 GA 中對包含許多其他計畫的 GA 進行投票的情況。\n\n我只用了2900萬 ADA 來支持其他23個計畫。\n\n在我看來，這些是生態系統迫切需要的計畫。\n\n我認為 Midgard、Starstream、Hydra、ZK Rollups、一個替代的 Cardano 節點、與 Bitcoin 的整合以及其他幾個計畫都是必須擁有的計畫。\n\n如果我遇到多個類似的提案，我更喜歡開源計畫和社群熟知的實體，或者那些已經交付了至今仍在使用的計畫的實體。\n\n我想強調的是，如果我投了反對票，可能意味著：\n\n• 我不喜歡這個計畫。它不應該從財政庫（或 Catalyst）獲得資金。\n\n• 我喜歡這個計畫，它應該向 Catalyst 申請資金。\n\n總的來說，我認為有商業成功雄心的計畫應該尋找其他資金來源。\n\n我不喜歡風險業務由財政庫資助，而在成功的情況下利潤被私有化的情況。\n\n如果計畫申請財政庫資金，它們應該制定一個策略，在成功的情況下將部分利潤返還給社群。\n\n此外，我認為如果是一家新創公司，團隊不能指望開發人員能拿到和 IOG 開發人員一樣的薪水。部分風險必須由團隊承擔，而不僅僅是財政庫。\n\n有些計畫沒有商業性質，例如函式庫、開發工具等。我們應該識別這些計畫，評估它們的益處，並可能支持它們。\n\n我支持的最後一個主要計畫是 Cardano 基金會的行銷策略。這也包括 Cardano 高峰會。\n\n總的來說，我不希望支持那些持有 Genesis 代幣但尚未使用的創始實體的計畫。Cardano 基金會就是這樣的實體，這在上一期 Catalyst 基金中得到了負面反映。\n\n另一方面，這個提案是行銷類別中最好的。Cardano 基金會支持生態系統中的許多活動。CF 希望長期保持活躍並支持生態系統建設，為此它需要獲得資金。\n\nCardano 高峰會和其他行銷活動的成本可能很高。我不希望冒這樣的風險：如果他們的提案未獲批准，下一屆 Cardano 高峰會將無法舉辦。加密產業可能會對此產生負面看法。\n\n我只支持了 Intersect 關於開源開發預算的一項提案。他們要求580萬 ADA。\n\n每天都有新的提案出現，所以我的決定可能不是最終的。我可能會做出改變。\n\n我的 DRep ID：\ndrep1km69g7ksf8t5g0h9d9tkrcd2tezxelx0wtr76rv2mrkl5nzd6v3",

Let's use the treasury to seed stablecoin liquidity to help prepare for the bull run. I've written a proposal with @Marco_112358. If you haven't, I recommend giving it a read.\n\nOne of the key aspects of the proposal is that no single entity can control the withdrawn funds, since funds will be withdrawn into a multi-sig wallet. The multi-sig wallet will be controlled by a management committee, where 4 of 7 signatures are required to take any action with the funds.\n\nThe 7 person committee will be composed of 1 representative from each of the founding entities (@emurgo_io, @InputOutputHK, and @Cardano_CF) and 4 community members. This partnership between the community and founding entities helps to pair the passion of the community with the interests and resources of the founding entities.\n\nPlease do share and leave feedback. If you haven't read the proposal yet, please do read it. Are there any spaces that would be interested in hosting an open discussion on this?\n\nhttps://t.co/tec5VsJxCk"

          "originalText": "💡 [Thoughts & Proposal] Reflections on Cardano Budget 2025\n\nAfter reading Adam Dean’s “Cardano Budget 2025,” I’d like to share my full support for the following key points he raised:\n\n✅ Community-led auditing and accountability\n✅ Transparent financial reporting and budget allocation\n✅ Elimination of unnecessary middle layers\n✅ A scalable and functional budgeting system\n\n💡 So what can we actually do right now?\n\nWhile I don’t believe halting the current process is the right move, I do believe we can and should launch an independent oversight team—one that monitors the ongoing budget process, audits implementation, and produces detailed reports for the community.\n\n🔍 Track transparency in execution\n🧾 Analyze RFP procedures and outcomes\n📊 Record decisions and context\n\nBy doing so with academic and neutral rigor, we’ll create something of real value for the community—not just reaction, but insight.\n\n🌱 Let’s acknowledge the reality: we are not yet fully decentralized.\n\nAnd that’s okay. We’re in a historical transition.\n\nOur responsibility is to document this process—its flaws, its breakthroughs, and everything in between—so that what we leave behind is a legacy, not just a result.\n\nIn this way, our mistakes and successes both become tools for future growth.\n\n🔁 I believe the Cardano ecosystem must thrive through free and open competition.\n\nFor that to happen, any proposal or authority must be evaluated and, if necessary, challenged openly.\n\nAnd that starts with us—with the community choosing to observe, report, and remember.\n\nCardano will evolve through our collective will and action.\n\nLet’s build something we can be proud to pass on.\nLet me know if you’d like this adapted for a Twitter/X thread or shortened for another format!"

          "originalText": "@JaromirTesar \n\nScalability and Funding - Plan is still the same.  Last I checked both Midgard and IOG teams are still making good progress on things, despite the fact that we have not withdrawn from the Cardano treasury in a very long time.  I don't think another 6 weeks while we pursue a better will slow progress meaningfully.\n\nCatalyst Funding - I'm not aware of these ecosystem teams that are \"fighting for survival\".  Catalyst has already been funded up through F13.  And how would any of these projects know that they would be approved for funding anyways?  IMHO a 6-week delay is perfectly fine.\n\nFlexibility of Governance - I'm aware that a new NCL can be passed that is lower.  However, I worry that once we have a high NCL passed, many of the top dReps who happen to have budget proposals will rigorously defend the high limit so that their proposals have a better chance.  Better to approve a low NCL and then raise it later if we have to IMHO.\n\nMarket Timing and Investment Windows - I don't think any of the budget proposals mentioned so far move the needle enough in a positive direction to be worth the ADA they are asking for.  What is the PMF we are trying to market?  What strategic initiatives other than ones in IOG's core proposal, Midgard, Starstream, Amaru, and Gerolamo are needed?  All of those combined are still less than 200M ADA.  Also, I support a stablecoin liquidity proposal, but it needs to be decoupled from Emurgo's omnibus proposal IMHO.\n\nChecks and Balances - The issue here is not necessarily that dReps will want to spend up to the cap.  It's that budget proposers will.  We don't have enough visibility into ANY of the proposals' true costs.  Example:  Maybe with a 150M NCL, IOG might propose 50M for their core proposal.  With 350M NCL, there is enough room for them to ask for 100M first just to see if it passes.  We WANT budget proposers to be *LIMITED* by the NCL to get them to compete to lower costs.\n\nMisuse Isn’t Solved by NCL Alone - Agreed.  But IMHO lowering the NCL will cause proposers to increase the *quality* of their proposals in order to compete with other proposers for a slice of a smaller pie.\n\nSelling Pressure and Timing - ADA is currently 5x below ATH.  I very much doubt that it will be on its way back down again 6 weeks from now.  In fact I think if we delay a little bit we'll be more likely to stretch the value of our ADA spent to go much further.\n\nThese are some of the main reasons I am strongly against approving a 350M NCL right now."

The reading of the constitution suggests there might be room for multiple budgets.\n\nDoes that mean one budget could be set for IOG/Intersect/etc and another could be set for other initiatives?\n\nI'm asking because a 200 million NCL would have a major negative impact on my 50 million stablecoin liquidity proposal since it would create competition between my proposal and the founding entities budgeting. This would very negatively impact the capacity for me to try and bring the community and founding entities together for something that could benefit Cardano.\n\nI want to try and bring everyone together to help build better relationships while working on a program that will support the treasury and community in the long term. However, this whole budget process is turning a lot of people into enemies that should be trying to work together."

No Administrator means no budget—and No Governance Execution--\nTreasury withdrawals cannot occur unless they are part of an approved budget and under the supervision of a designated administrator.

          "originalText": "Stable coin proposal full version below:\n\nAbstract\nThe goal of this proposal is to increase liquidity on Cardano, specifically by supporting stablecoin liquidity. 50,000,000 ADA is requested over the course of 12 months (the duration of the budget) to support the Cardano decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. The majority of the funds in this budget will be disbursed to DeFi protocols including decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and lending protocols to help seed liquidity on Cardano. The funds are managed by a 7 person administrating committee composed of publicly identified individuals who are part of multi-signature (multisig) wallet from which liquidity will be managed. This budget is proposed independent of other efforts since the goal of this budget is not to pay developers or companies for ecosystem improvements, rather to increase liquidity in the system overall. Further, unlike other proposals this budget serves as a revenue stream for the Cardano treasury since yields from DeFi protocols will be sent back to the Cardano treasury.\n\nMotivation\nHigh Level Overview\nAmount - The Cardano treasury should dedicate 3.33% of treasury funds (50 million ada) to purchasing fiat backed stablecoins, spread out over 12 monthly purchases. The committee should make every effort to help mitigate the potential price impact of converting ADA to fiat to mint as stable coins over the 12 month period. Note that up to 35% of funds may be held in ADA to pair with ADA/Stablecoin pairs on DEXs, which will help to alleviate price impact concerns.\nAdministration - A 7 person administrating committee will manage the treasury reserve using a multisig wallet (4 of 7 signature validation) to hold and deploy funds to protocols. The administrating committee will be responsible for working with stablecoin issuers to convert ADA to fiat backed stablecoins and deploying liquidity. A specific focus of the administrating committee will be analyzing approaches of deploying ADA to stablecoins in a way that minimizes ADA price impact.\nRevenue - Deployed funds will increase in value according to the interest and fees defined by the protocols fees are disbursed to. Each month the total interest generated by the deployed liquidity will be calculated and 15% of accumulated interest from protocols will be withdrawn from the respective protocols and sent back to the treasury, while the remaining 85% of accumulated interest will remain in the protocol (e.g. analagous but not identical to compounding interest). ADA held by the committee that is not deployed will not be staked according to constitutional requirements (see Rationale for more information).\nDeployment - DeFi protocols with at least 250,000 ADA worth of a stablecoin may apply to be recipients of minted stablecoin, and the administrating committee will review and disburse funds to protocols that have the best plans for growth and returns back to the treasury. A maximum of 2 or 3 protocols may be used per DeFi category to help minimize fragmentation. Applicants should make a strong case for the use of their protocol, including a a description of historical success, security, dedicated support for handling issues, and features of the protocol that will maximize the value to the Cardano treasury if liquidity is deployed to the protocol. New protocols will not be excluded for having limited history, but must make a strong case in other areas of the application.\nStrategy - The committee will deploy funds on a monthly basis in a way that minimizes ADA price impact and fees. A specific focus should be on deployment of liquidity that can be \"passively\" managed, meaning frequent adjustements are not needed. The focus on passive management is to help ease the management strategy and reduce the fees incurred by managing liquidity. This may be changed in the future by an on chain Info Action.\nAudits and Transparency - The committee is responsible for creating a monthly report or building a dashboard (or both) to describe the ADA held in reserve, the funds deployed to protocols, and all fees and other costs associated with managing the treasury. The committee may use part of the monthly budget to develop a dashboard to provide live updates of the stablecoin reserve for the Cardano community.\nCosts - Each member of the committee will be compensated $2,000/month in the fiat backed stablecoin of their choice ($14,000/month total for all committee members). The stablecoin reserve fund will cover the costs of minting fiat backed stables, deployment of liquidity to protocols, and rebalancing if needed. The committe will also use some funds to perform KYB/KYC of 3rd parties as needed as well as cover costs for creation of a legal entity to house the fund. Total costs per month should be capped at $50,000/month over the 12 month period. Any costs that extend beyond the budget period should be deducted from the accrued interest.\nOrganization - Part of the initial budget will be used to investigate proper incorporation of a legal entity to house the funds being managed for this budget. Every reasonable attempt should be made to house the fund in a non-profit to maximize tax benefits as well as provide future opportunities for organizations to donate to the fund.\nRevisions - Since this fund may exist in perpetuity due to funds not being directly spent, it is important to have a mechanism for modification up to and including returning all funds back to the treasury. To this end, any member of the Cardano community may submit an Info Action to modify any aspect of this budget including members of the committee, monthly budget limits, committee pay, and returning some or all of funds back to the treasury. All members of the committee must commit to following any on chain Info Action that is passed by 67% of the community vote. If a committee member does not feel they can continue with their duties at any time, they must continue to carry out their duties until a suitable replacement is found according to the impeachment and replacement mechanisms described below.\nGoverning Committee\nTerm Limits\nCommunity members have a maximum term limit of 2 years, after which they can re-apply for a second 2 year term. A minimum of 4 community members (not affiliated with founding entities) must be on the committee at all times.\n\nFounding entities may have at most 1 person each on the committee. There are no term limits for committee members that represent a founding entity, but must still abide by the removal process of an Info Action or a majority vote of the other committee members.\n\nRetirement and Impeachment\nIn the event that a committee member retires or their signing keys are exposed, the remaining members of the committee must create a new multisig address with the same policy (4 of 7) that removes the retired address. This process also gives the committee the capacity to impeach inactive members of the committee, as well as the ability for the community to impeach one or more members through an info action.\n\nCommunity Feedback\nThe administrating committee members should make themselves available to feedback and questions from the Cardano community, and make attempts to make changes that incorporate reasonable feedback from the community. Feedback can be received through a Telegram channel, on Twitter, scheduled town hall meetings not more than once per month. The administrating committee should make attempts to incorporate feedback from the Cardano community, but are not obligated to do so. If the administrating committee does not respond or refuses to incorporate changes, the Cardano community may submit an on chain Info Action (that achieves 67% approval) to compel the committee to make changes up to and including removal of one or more members and/or returning some or all funds back to the treasury.\n\nPeople\nBelow are 6 of the 7 members of the initial administrating committee. They range in experience and background to help ensure the long term success and sustainability of the stablecoin liquidity. There is an ongoing search for a 7th member of the committee and will be included in the withdrawal action.\n\nLinda Roland (aka CryptoFly)Twitter - @cryptofly777\nYouTube - https://t.co/FbNtOdQ1ML\nAbout - Linda Roland is the operator of MALU Pool and has been actively contributing to the Cardano ecosystem since 2021.

I’m an engineer by day, and at all times a dancer, humanitarian, idealist, and entrepreneur. With a strong foundation in cloud technologies, programming, and blockchain, I’m passionate about building tools and communities that make decentralized futures more accessible — and a little more fun.\n\nRationale\nConstitutionality of the Budget\nPurpose: This proposal is for work intended to enhance the long term sustainability of Cardano by increasing stablecoin liquidity in the ecosystem.\nArticle III(5): This proposal fulfills this section of the Cardano Constitution by containing a Title, Abstract, Reason for Proposal (Motivation and Rationale), and Supporting Materials. An off-chain copy of this proposal can be found at https://t.co/uJRvuGJ3SG, and the document hash is attached to the transaction to fulfill the other requirements of this section.\nArticle IV(1): We propose that this budget span 73 epochs (roughly 1 calendar year).\nArticle IV(2): Disbursements for this budget must be made to a multi-signature (multisig) wallet composed of at least seven independent administrating members with at 4 of 7 signing policy. The process of overseeing funds then requires 4 of the 7 independent administrating members agree to disbursement of funds to DeFi protocols. The wallet must be the owner of any liquidity deposited into DeFi protocols, meaning liquidity tokens or any other assurance of liquidity must be held in the multisig wallet and should not be delegated to a third party, except as required for conversion of assets to fiat or minting of stablecoins. With this design, the committee will be the administrator of the budget funds and will directly oversee distribution of funds to protocols.\nArticle IV(3): At the time of submission, the NCL is currently at 350 million ADA and there is only one budget requesting 1.5 million ADA that has been submitted on chain through an info action. We believe that this removes a potential constitutional barrier for this proposal based on Article IV(3), since this proposal requests 50 million ADA of the potential remaining 348.5 million ADA.\nArticle IV(4): We budget 2,000 ADA/month (24,000 ADA total) to cover the costs of audits and transparency. The building of a dashboard and quarterly reporting in the proposed work also fulfill the obligations of this section. Since all funds will be managed from a single account, including all liquidity holdings and disbursement of monthly stipends for administrating committee members, we believe the dashboard and monthly reports are sufficient for auditing. To further strengthen our commitment to the auditing requirement, we also commit to any community driven requests for independent audits via an Info Action, and will use funds up to the $50,000/month budget to work with an independent auditor.\nArticle IV(5): The nature of the proposed work fulfills the first requirement of Article IV(5) of the constitution. The holding of all assets in the multisig account composed of 7 independent signers improves the ability of the Cardano community to easily audit and track actions taken by the committee. To fulfill the second part of the section, funds will not be delegated to an SPO and will be delegated to the predefined auto-abstain voting option.\nTREASURY-04a: There is not on chain withdrawal action for this budget, and one will not be submitted unless this budget achieves the necessary 50% approval. @ElderM @Marco_112358 @ESCOweb3 @palmeconomy @nbxcom @planetmaaz here is the link on govtools https://t.co/PVhnhZyXTF"

          "text": "✅ 我投票贊成了 Amaru 計畫。\n\n我的理由\n\n節點多樣性對於去中心化和網路彈性至關重要。當多個獨立團隊建構節點軟體時，可以減少對單一實體（例如 Cardano 的 IOG）的依賴。\n\n它最大限度地降低了與單一文化軟體開發相關的系統性風險。\n\n區塊鏈網路的核心承諾之一是高可用性，包括對攻擊和審查的強大抵抗力。\n\n雖然沒有系統可以保證100%的正常運行時間，但擁有多個節點實現可以提高網路的穩健性。如果某個版本中存在錯誤或漏洞，其他版本可能不受影響，從而限制潛在的損害。\n\n鼓勵額外的節點實現也有助於加深對協議的理解。隨著越來越多的開發人員建構和維護節點，他們有助於完善協議規範，發現模糊之處，並提高長期可維護性。\n\n這也透過建立更清晰、經過更多實戰檢驗的標準來支持未來的用戶端。\n\n相比之下，Bitcoin 在很大程度上依賴於單一實現：Bitcoin Core。雖然存在替代方案（例如 btcd、Bitcoin Knots），但它們很少被使用，這使得網路嚴重依賴於單一的開發團隊。\n\n在圍繞 OP_RETURN 操作碼和 Ordinals 的使用等治理爭議期間，這種中心化變得尤為明顯。\n\n相比之下，Ethereum 為其共識層和執行層都擁有多個積極維護的實現。其中包括 Geth、Nethermind、Besu、Erigon（執行層）和 Prysm、Lighthouse、Teku、Nimbus（共識層）等用戶端。\n\n這種多樣性增強了 Ethereum 的去中心化，並使網路對任何單個用戶端中的錯誤和效能問題更具彈性。\n\n然而，節點多樣性也帶來了挑戰。\n\n如果未經仔細測試，不同的實現可能會導致共識錯誤或臨時的鏈分叉。\n\n協調的測試網和協議級別的規範清晰度對於降低這些風險至關重要。\n\n協議升級也可能需要更長的時間，因為所有實現都必須整合和驗證變更，例如即將到來的 Ouroboros Leios，IOG 和 Amaru 節點都需要支持。\n\n持續的資金是另一個考慮因素。\n\n維護多個完整的節點實現是資源密集型的，並且可能需要 Cardano 財政庫的長期支持。\n\n然而，這種多樣性帶來的去中心化、安全性和社群參與度的提高證明了成本的合理性。\n\nAmaru 團隊的資金請求是合理的，特別是與 IOG 所需的預算相比。\n\n該團隊包括來自 Cardano 生態系統內部受人尊敬的開發人員，並得到多個信譽良好的實體的支持。他們提出的基於 Rust 的節點實現將是 IOG 基於 Haskell 的 Cardano 節點的一個重要替代方案，標誌著生態系統彈性向前邁出了關鍵一步。\n\n這一舉措加強了去中心化，提高了協議的穩健性，並代表了 Cardano 網路的健康發展。\n\n我的 DRep ID：\ndrep1km69g7ksf8t5g0h9d9tkrcd2tezxelx0wtr76rv2mrkl5nzd6v3",

          "originalText": "Will support this proposal on the condition that it sets a precedent for special treatment to treasury capital injections.\n\nThere needs to be strict criteria that ensure:\n\nCapital injections from treasury funds into DeFi protocols are exempt from dApp fees (either the fees are waived or are regularly reimbursed to the treasury or the DAO managing the treasury). Managed treasury funds which are designed to deepen liquidity as a public good / service cannot be subject to DeFi protocol fees. \n\nThis is of critical importance, as without this, we can easily end up in a situation where treasury funds are eaten up by DeFi protocol DAOs (a single order with a 0.3% fee on 50,000,000 Ada incurs a 150,000 Ada fee).\n\nAdditionally, while this is not a hard requirement for me, I would like to see the proposed stablecoin breakdown. It would be best if the liquidity could all be injected into a single stablecoin, otherwise this amount is insufficient to solve the slippage problem (which is why current stablecoins have low utilization / adoption). We need a single stablecoin with at-least 50M USD in active DEX liquidity, or as close to it as we can get."

          "originalText": "As Cardano’s 2025 budget process gains momentum, multiple proposals have emerged to reassess the Net Change Limit (NCL). Here’s a breakdown of the current situation:\n\n✅ Approved: The 2025 NCL of 350M ADA has been formally ratified by DReps. It’s based on a 2024 treasury income model (approx. 336M ADA) and now serves as the foundation for current budget deliberations.\n\n❌ Rejected: A more conservative proposal to cap 2025 at 300M ADA and 2026 at 250M ADA was not approved.\n\n🟠 Under Review:\n“2025 Cardano NCL” proposes lowering the NCL to 200M ADA, urging a cautious approach during this first year of decentralized treasury governance.\n“300M ADA for Epochs 563–635” aims to establish an NCL for early 2026, supporting budget continuity across overlapping periods.\n\nMeanwhile, several new funding proposals have been submitted:\n\n1⃣ 7.5M ADA for Community Builder Proposals — includes only those with ≥2.69B ADA support, excluding proposals from Intersect and founding entities.\n\n2⃣ 1.5M ADA for Amaru Rust Node Development — a PRAGMA-led initiative to diversify Cardano nodes and enhance network resilience.\n\n3⃣ 50M ADA for DeFi Liquidity — aims to seed liquidity into DEXs and stablecoins, with yield partially returned to the treasury.\n\nAs SIPO DRep, we’re evaluating these developments based on:\n\n🔍 Cautious governance: supports the 200M ADA NCL.\n🚀 Growth & momentum: supports maintaining the 350M ADA cap.\n⚖️ Balanced compromise: 300M ADA could be a pragmatic middle ground.\n\nFor funding proposals, our assessment will focus on:\nDoes it generate a return to the treasury?\nIs transparency and execution capacity ensured?\nDoes it set a strong precedent for the first year of decentralized financial governance?\n\nThe NCL is more than just a number — it reflects Cardano’s financial philosophy and growth trajectory. Changing the cap directly impacts which proposals are viable.\n\nWe’ll soon publish SIPO’s evaluation criteria and vote logic for each major proposal. In the meantime, we welcome your input before the voting begins.\n\nIf you support our work as a DRep, please consider delegating:\n\nDRep ID:\ndrep1yffld2866p00cyg3ejjdewtvazgah7jjgk0s9m7m5ytmmdq33v3zh\n\nFor Daedalus:\ndrep120m237kstm7pzywv5nwtjm8gj8dl55j9nupwlkapz77mgv7zu7l"

We cannot, imo, sit here and spend ADA for development and not provide an efficient high liquidity market for the developed apps and enhancements to thrive in.  \n\nThat said, while I’m favor, the 50M ask is bit too high given what has already been approved and expected for Intersects overall upcoming budget and the subsequent proposals we’re seeing come in.

          "originalText": "VOTE ❌: Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Budget - 275M ada Administered by Intersect \n\n===================\nPlease redelegate to another DRep, if you disagree with my NO vote. If you redelegate to a YES voting DRep, it will count as a YES. \n===================\n\nRATIONALE\nI am voting NO on the proposed 2025 Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Budget because I believe the total amount requested is too high, especially  for the first year of minimum viable on-chain governance. \n\nI also believe that bundling 39 proposals together into a single vote limits DReps’ ability to express the differentiated support that we saw in earlier stages. This approach flattens nuance and imposes an all-or-nothing decision on a diverse set of funding priorities.\n\nI also acknowledge the existence of the three founding entities that were allocated Genesis ADA that are working with different levels of success to improve Cardano according to their original missions. Some of these missions have been nominally completed, some of these missions continue in their original form, some continue in a new form. I do not pretend to know all the nuances. \n\nStill I take that as a factor in my decision-making. Treasury funds should be used judiciously in complement and in awareness of the existence of the entities. \n\nThis vote against this Budget in its full size is based on:\n\n1. My participation in the DRep voting stage and the level of DRep participation as a whole;\n2. The level of support that some proposals received relative to others;\n3. The relative importance of certain proposals vs others and the quality of the teams and their dedication to Cardano’s mission;\n4. And the expectation that Catalyst will likely gain sufficient support (in this or future budget proposals) to continue to support smaller, experimental, or commercial projects.\n\nWhile spending from the Treasury is not new (Catalyst has done it before), this is the first major annual on-chain budget, and it sets a precedent.\n\nIn my view, the issue is not inflation within the Cardano economy — most ADA will not be used to buy NFTs or FTs. Nor is it simply about a slightly higher disinflation rate. The deeper issue is ADA devaluation due to external sell pressure. Most of the funded ADA will be exchanged for fiat (USD, EUR, etc.), not recycled internally. This adds downward pressure on ADA’s price.\n\nIt is a see-saw that has its quirks. \n\nIn a real-world economy, if you spend more to \"jumpstart\" the economy, face inflation if the supply of services and goods cannot meet demand. \n\nIn a still nascent blockchain economy, spending more essentially means converting the native token for fiat, and the result is devaluation. We are not exchanging ADA directly for Cardano economy goods and services, we are selling it into the real world. The ADA is not recycled internally. This adds downward pressure on ADA’s price.\n\nThis devaluation affects everyone:\n\n1. The most important funded projects\n2. The projects that were not funded\n3. The builders who didn’t ask for funding \n4. The ADA holders who fund all of it through opportunity cost\n\nOf course, that is unavoidable. Most of the ADA allocated will likely be converted to fiat (USD, EUR, etc.) to pay for services, not retained or reused within the ecosystem. This creates exchange rate pressure, weakening ADA’s value.\n\nThe question isn’t whether devaluation will occur — it will. The real question is: Where do we draw the line? Do all 39 proposals in this budget bring more value than the cost of the devaluation they collectively impose? Do we need to bundle them all in one YES/NO budget vote? I think No. \n\nWe are approving a large, externally-focused budget at a time when Cardano’s “blockchain economy” and governance mechanism is still immature and internally fragile.\n\nTreasury funds should primarily be focused on critical public goods in different forms. Especially if they are open source; support infrastructure, research, tools, even education, promotion of Cardano. This applies when the goods align with the long-term mission of Cardano as public infrastructure. Yes, there may be exceptions that emerge, but those exceptions are expensive — and others will pay for them.\n\nIf we overfund less impactful proposals, we risk undermining the impact of the most critical ones, simply by diluting the value of what they are paid in.\n\nFor this reason, I believe a smaller, phased budget focused tightly on foundational public goods would be a better and safer starting point.\n\nI include this rationale as an earnest view of the proposed budget action with the aim of contributing to the process by encouraging the submitter (Intersect) to take more factors into account."

        "abstract": "The Cardano Constitution, at Article IV, Section 3, requires that before withdrawal of Treasury funds, the community must have established a Net Change Limit (NCL). This means passing a NCL in a formal on-chain governance info action. The NCL represents the maximum amount of ada which may be withdrawn from the Cardano Treasury in a given period. We believe that the NCL covering the period from the start of epoch 563 to the end of epoch 635 should be 300M ADA.",

        "rationale": "We believe that the NCL covering the period from the start of epoch 563 to the end of epoch 635 should be 300M ADA. Due to delays in the budget process, some proposals may be approved after June 2025. Since many budgets span approximately 12 months, defining the NCL for a similar period ensures continuity in Treasury-funded activities. 300M ADA is close to the expected inflow into the Treasury during this period. A 'yes' vote on this proposal means agreeing to the proposed NCL, which will replace any previous NCL if approved.",

          "originalText": "Let me explain the Net Change Limit in context.\n\nThe Net Change Limit (NCL) serves as a prevention against excessive withdrawal of ADA from the Treasury.\n\nThe NCL defines the maximum amount of ADA that can be withdrawn from the Treasury in a given period. This period is usually one year, which corresponds to 72 epochs.\n\nThe NCL can be defined as the amount of ADA for a given period. An alternative approach would be to express it as a percentage of Treasury revenue for a given past period.\n\nFor example, as 80% of Treasury revenue for the last 72 epochs.\n\nIt is up to the community to choose what they like best. \n\nThe first approach is more flexible because it is necessary to approve the NCL every year. The second approach could work in the long term without annual approval.\n\nThe NCL must be approved through governance action before it is possible to submit a proposal for withdrawal of ADA from the Treasury.\n\nThe NCL applies to all withdrawals from the Treasury in a given period.\n\nOnce the total number of ADA individually withdrawn from the Treasury reaches the defined NCL, further withdrawals exceeding the limit will become unconstitutional.\n\nThere is currently no NCL defined, so withdrawals are not possible.\n\nThere are two governance actions regarding NCL for next year.\n\nThe first one submitted by the community tries to set the NCL at 300M ADA. The second one from intersect sets 350M ADA.\n\nThere are currently 1.71B ADA in the Cardano Treasury.\n\nRevenues to the treasury consist of monetary expansion and fees. Fees are currently almost negligible. \n\nMost of the revenues consist of monetary expansion, i.e. the gradual transfer of ADA from the reserve to the Treasury.\n\nThere are currently 7.2B ADA in the reserve. The reserve is used to pay out staking rewards and deposit ADA into the Treasury.\n\nThe reserve is gradually trending towards 0. With each subsequent epoch, the reserve is decreasing. \n\nTreasury revenues will depend on fees and possibly other alternative revenues in the future.\n\nNCL is to prevent the rapid depletion of the Treasury, as ADA should be used to grow the ecosystem. \n\nBy this you can imagine a payment to IOG for the delivery of Ouroboros Leios, but also, for example, minting stablecoins. Basically, anything that the community approves.\n\nThere is a consensus that expenses should not be higher than Treasury revenues. NCL should reflect this. However, it is theoretically possible to approve NCL higher than Treasury revenues.\n\nAn important aspect of NCL is the direct negative impact on the market price of ADA. Entities that receive ADA from the Treasury can sell coins on the market to cover their living expenses.\n\nSelling pressure can harm SPOs and stakers.\n\nUltimately, this can also have a negative impact on Treasury, because if the market price of ADA is low in a bear market, it will be necessary to sell even more ADA in the coming years.\n\nIt is necessary to find a balance between the potential long-term positive impact of the investment and the medium-term market price of ADA.\n\nNCL does not mean that we have to spend a defined maximum. It is possible to approve an NCL of 350M ADA, but still, only 200M ADA can be approved in total spending in a given period.\n\nNCL is only an insurance against exceeding the limit. \n\nMore important are individual withdrawals. Each of them must be justified and we must be sure that the investment will have a positive impact on the ecosystem from the long-term perspective."

          "text": "8BALL Drep 已對 2025-2026 NCL 投了贊成票。\n\n對 2025-2026 NCL 資訊行動投贊成票的理由。\n1. 肯定努力\n我想肯定那些在緊張的時間限制下，且幾乎沒有先例可循的情況下準備此資訊行動的人們的努力。儘管該提案存在不足，但這份肯定是支撐我務實支持的基礎。\n\n2. NCL 提款金額定義不清\n淨變化限額 (NCL) 在 Cardano 憲法或提案中均未明確定義，這與社群對「淨變化限額」的新興理解有所不同。雖然這種缺乏明確性的問題很重要，但這並不足以成為拒絕该提案的理由。\n\n3. 門檻的合憲性\n提案規定需要獲得活躍投票權益的 67% 才能通過。\n這引發了一個關於憲法 TREASURY-01a 防護條款意圖的問題，因為它沒有明確說明 50% 的「門檻」值是防護條款身份的內在組成部分，還是僅僅是確定 NCL 提案是否達成一致的機制的一部分。\n\n具體來說，「TREASURY-01a」是否意味著 NCL 需要得到超過 50% 活躍投票權益的批准，並將門檻作為防護條款的核心部分？還是說它意味著 NCL 必須超過至少 50% 的獨立門檻，並根據提案的支持度在單獨的步驟中進行衡量以確認一致？\n\n如果憲法的 50% 門檻是防護條款的內在組成部分，那麼試圖將門檻更改為 67% 可能會被視為違憲。但是，如果防護條款是一個獨立的基準並且其條件得到滿足，則該提案是合憲的，批准過程將繼續。如果提案未能獲得超過提案者設定的 67% 門檻的批准，則該提案無法達成一致。我相信允許高於 50% 的門檻可以增強治理的嚴謹性，並支持提案者設定它，因為他們可以設定投票期。然而，啟用此功能需要修改憲法、更新分類帳規則和修訂投票工具。因此，我接受投票必須超過 50% 才能就 NCL 達成一致。\n\n4. 支持文件的不可篡改性\n批准後編輯支持文件的能力構成了重大風險，可能損害提案的完整性。這個問題需要 Constitutional Committee 的關注，以強制執行不可篡改性並維護流程的可信度。\n\n5. 多年範圍的擔憂\n鑑於 Cardano 治理的當前成熟度，單年預算範圍可能更合適，新的 NCL 提案可能會在 2026 年之前取代此提案。然而，2025 年預算最終確定的延遲使得將 2.5 億 ADA 作為明年的 NCL 具有優勢。這鼓勵了更早開始 2026 年預算流程的討論。我預計新的 2026 NCL 限額提案將取代此資訊行動，但不會在 2025 年底之前。\n\n6. 預算期與時間表錯位\n由於 2025 年第一季度已經過去，NCL 全年 3 億 ADA 的價值引發了對過去工作可能存在的未申報補發款項的擔憂，除非明確說明，否則我對此表示反對。NCL 應按比例反映正在資助的剩餘時間表，以確保資源分配的準確性。\n\n7. 2025 年預算的迫切需求\n迫切需要一個預算上限來限制 2025 年路線圖和預算的國庫提款，包括 Ouroboros Leios 和 ZK 技術的工作。此限制必須在國庫穩定與提高性能以保持 Cardano 競爭力的需求之間取得平衡。雖然提議的 3 億 ADA 上限很高，但考慮到當前的預算討論，這是可以接受的。\n\n8. NCL 價值對齊與預算審慎\nNCL 價值 (2025 年 3 億 ADA 和 2026 年 2.5 億 ADA) 與兩年期間預計的國庫流入量合理地保持一致。我更喜歡維持盈餘的預算，尤其是在當前動盪的加密貨幣環境下。2025 年較低的 NCL (約 2 億 ADA) 將反映預算流程的初期狀態，加強審慎的貨幣政策，並減輕國庫提款對 ADA 價格的負面影響。\n然而，預算決策的迫切需求優先於我對降低價值的偏好。\n\n9. 基於百分比的限制\n採用基於國庫流入量的百分比限制可以增強可預測性，並作為簡化未來預算流程的防護措施。\n\n10. 結論\n儘管在憲法要求方面存在不規範之處以及其他擔憂，但 2025 年預算的迫切需求證明了忽視這些問題是合理的。雖然出於財政謹慎我會傾向於較低的 NCL 值，但通過預算的優先性迫使我投贊成票。Constitutional Committee 可以解決此處提出的問題，以完善治理實踐。",

          "originalText": "8BALL Drep has voter YES to 2025-2026 NCL.\n\nRationale for Voting Yes to 2025-2026 NCL  InfoAction.\n1. Recognition of Effort\nI want to recognize the efforts of those who prepared this Info-Action under tight time constraints and with minimal precedent to guide them.\nThis acknowledgment underpins my pragmatic support for the proposal, despite its shortcomings.\n\n2. Unclear Definition of NCL Withdrawal Amount\nThe Net Change Limit (NCL) is not clearly defined in either the Cardano constitution or the proposal, diverging from the community’s emerging understanding of a \"net change limit.\" While this lack of clarity is significant, it does not warrant rejecting the proposal. \n\n3. Constitutionality of Threshold\nThe proposal specifies a 67% threshold of the active voting stake to pass. \nThis raises a question of the constitution's guardrail TREASURY-01a intent for it leaves unclear whether the \"threshold\" value of 50% is an intrinsic part of the \nguardrail’s identity or merely part of a mechanism to establish if the NCL proposal is agreed. \n\nSpecifically, does 'TREASURY-01a' mean an NCL requires approval by more than 50% of the active voting stake, with the threshold as a core part of the guardrail? Or does it imply the NCL must exceed a standalone threshold of at least 50%, with the proposal’s support measured against it in a separate step to confirm agreement?\"\n\nIf the constitution's 50% threshold is intrinsic to the guardrail, attempting to change the threshold to 67% could be deemed unconstitutional. \nHowever, if the guardrail is a standalone benchmark and its conditions are met the proposal is constitutional and the approval process continues.\nIf the proposal does not garner approval exceeding the proposer's threshold of 67% the proposal cannot be agreed.\nI believe allowing a threshold above 50% enhances governance rigor and support proposers setting it, as they can set the voting period. However, enabling this functionality would require amending the constitution, updating ledger rules, and revising voting tools. Thus, I accept that the vote must exceed only 50% to agree an NCL.\n\n4. Immutability of Supporting Documents\nThe ability to edit supporting documents after approval poses a significant risk, potentially undermining the proposal’s integrity. This issue requires attention from \nthe Constitutional Committee to enforce immutability and maintain trust in the process.\n\n5. Multi-Year Scope Concern\nGiven the current maturity of Cardano’s governance, a single-year budget scope might be more appropriate, with a new NCL proposal potentially superseding this proposal before 2026. However, the delay in finalizing the 2025 budget makes the inclusion of 250 million ada as next year's NCL advantageous. It encourages discussions for the2026 budget process earlier. I would expect a new 2026 NCL limit proposal to supercede this info action but not before the end of 2025. \n\n6. Budget Period and Timeline Misalignment\nWith the 2025 first quarter past, the NCL’s full-year value of 300 million ADA raises concerns about potential back payments for prior work, which I oppose unless explicitly specified. \nThe NCL should proportionally reflect the remaining timeline being funded to ensure accuracy in resource allocation.\n\n7. Urgent Need for a 2025 Budget\nA budget ceiling is urgently needed to cap treasury withdrawals for the 2025 roadmap and budget, including work on Ouroboros Leios and ZK technologies. This limit must balance treasury stability with the demand for improved performance to keep Cardano competitive. While the proposed 300 million ada maximum is high, it’s acceptable given current budget discussions.\n\n8. NCL Value Alignment and Budget Prudence\nThe NCL values (300 million ada for 2025 and 250 million for 2026) align reasonably with projected treasury inflows over the two-year period. I prefer budgets that maintain a surplus, especially given the current volatile cryptocurrency climate. A lower NCL for 2025, around 200 million ada, would reflect the nascent state of the budget process, reinforce prudent monetary policy and mitigate the negative effect on ada price by treasury withdrawls. \nHowever, the pressing need for a budget decision supersedes my preference for a reduced value.\n\n9. Percentage based limits\nAdopting percentage-based limits based on treasury inflows could enhance predictability and serve as guardrails to streamline future budget processes.\n\n10. Conclusion\nDespite irregularities in constitutional requirements, and other concerns, the urgent need for a 2025 budget justifies overlooking these issues. While I’d favor a lower NCL value out of fiscal caution, the priority of passing a budget compels me to vote YES. The Constitutional Committee can address the issues raised here to refine governance practices."

Instead, it establishes a cap on the total amount that can be withdrawn from the treasury across all budgets over a specific period—in this case, throughout 2025. I realize I’m being precise here, but with the existing confusion around governance in the community, I want to avoid any misunderstanding by others that could lead to an expectation of spending 300 million ADA this year."

          "text": "我投票反對 ⛔️ 將淨變化限額 (NCL) 降至 200M ADA，這是迄今為止最艱難的治理決策之一。\n\n感覺這裡似乎沒有完全好的選擇。\n\n而且，我自己也曾呼籲降低 NCL。\n\n當前 350M ADA 的 NCL 存在一些顯著的缺陷。\n\n如果巨大的拋售壓力導致 ADA 價格大幅下跌，比如跌至 0.2 USD，可能會帶來嚴峻的挑戰。\n\n以美元計算資助生態系統將需要從國庫中出售大量 ADA，從而導致拋售壓力的惡性循環，使情況進一步惡化。\n\nCardano Whale (@cardano_whale) 指出，像 Tezos 和 Polkadot 這樣的一些項目在其生態系統中投入了大量資金，擁有創新技術，但仍難以獲得實質性的關注。\n\n我完全同意這一點。\n\n對於區塊鏈而言，保持在市值排名前 10 的位置至關重要。\n\n散戶投資者、機構和加密貨幣愛好者不僅根據技術，還根據市場表現來評估項目。\n\n如果 Cardano 長期跌出前 10 名，無論其去中心化程度或像 Ouroboros Leios 這樣的技術進步如何，它可能永遠無法恢復其地位。\n\n這是一個需要考慮的重要因素，即使感覺不公平或主觀。\n\n另一方面，將 NCL 降至 200M ADA 也有其自身的擔憂。\n\nCardano 需要投資來推進其技術、支持建設者並發展生態系統。如果沒有增加的用戶活動，國庫收入將不會增長。\n\n未來幾年用於維護和開發的支出可能會耗盡準備金，最終使 Cardano 在經濟上不可持續。\n\n協議的安全性也取決於有吸引力的權益獎勵和激勵措施。此外，如果沒有活躍的開發者、工具和不斷發展的 DeFi 生態系統，Ouroboros Leios 的潛力將無法發揮。在所有這些領域的投資都至關重要。\n\nIOG 已經明確了他們的資金需求：核心開發需要 96M ADA，Catalyst 需要 69M ADA，研究需要 27M ADA。總計 192M ADA。IOG 的提議很簡單：要麼批准這筆資金，要麼就此作罷。\n\n關於公平性、IOG 和 Charles 過去的貢獻以及 Cardano「完成」定義的辯論都有其道理，但現實是 IOG 在協議方面擁有無與倫比的專業知識。沒有其他實體能夠以同樣的速度或質量有效地接管維護、開發和研究工作。\n\n如果 DReps 將 192M ADA 分配給 IOG，那麼其他項目只剩下 8M ADA。\n\n在審查了預算提案後，我只支持了我認為生態系統絕對需要的那些基本項目：像 Midgard、Starstream、Hydra、ZK Rollups、Blockfrost、Lucid、Chainlink 整合等項目。\n\n僅就 CORE 類別而言，這大約相當於 12M ADA。在所有類別中，我批准的總預算為 213M ADA。\n\n鑑於我自己估計的所需支出為 213M ADA，我無法支持 200M ADA 的 NCL。\n\n這將與我在必要項目資金與我批准的上限方面的立場相矛盾。這種不一致性引導我決定投票反對降低 NCL。\n\nCardano 需要有效的行銷和改進的治理支持，因為目前的情況遠非理想。\n\n投資生態系統和推進新技術必須齊頭並進，以確保可持續增長。\n\n在我看來，批准 200M ADA 的 NCL 將意味著維持現狀，將所有關鍵責任留给 IOG，同時忽視對更廣泛生態系統的投資。從本質上講，這將限制對那些對生態系統至關重要的實體的資助，就像 IOG 一樣。\n\n一個重要的考慮因素是圍繞 NCL 的預期情景。\n\n在我看來，350M ADA 和 200M ADA 這兩個 NCL 都是極端的。\n\n當前設定為 350M ADA 的 NCL 獲得了強而有力的支持，有 76% 的投票權益參與其中。幾乎所有的投票權益都批准了它。將 NCL 從 350M 大幅削減至 200M ADA 要麼是不負責任的，要麼是過於雄心勃勃的。\n\n接下來會發生什麼？建設者、Intersect、IOG 或其他人可能會提交一項新的治理行動，提議一個中間的 NCL，可能是 250M 或 300M ADA。或者，可能會同時提交多個提案。\n\n這種情況會造成一個不穩定的環境，這是適得其反且難以支持的。這種不穩定會破壞進展。\n\n此外，加密社群對 Cardano 生態系統能負擔多少投資的冗長辯論興趣不大。\n\n在不穩定的環境中，即使提出一個連貫的預算也幾乎是不可能的。\n\n目前，我們的 NCL 是 350M ADA。考慮一下這個可能的情景：\n\nIntersect 預計將為 6 月份到期的預算提交一項治理行動。與此同時，如果到 5 月底批准了新的 200M ADA NCL，那麼除非在新的 NCL 生效前獲得批准，否則提議的預算實際上將變得違憲。\n\n這使流程複雜化，並進一步凸顯了突然、極端變化帶來的問題。\n\n通過治理行動來辯論 NCL 既低效又耗時。\n\n社群的共識似乎很可能在 250M 至 300M ADA 之間。然而，在鏈上投票之前沒有進行過鏈下意向調查（大多數社群成員會對此做出回應），這導致目前的 NCL 僅僅是為了讓預算流程得以繼續而被批准。\n\nNCL 本身的概念開始讓人覺得沒有必要，因為它會根據多數票不斷變化。如果投票權益同意增加或減少 NCL，這必然會發生。\n\n重要的是要強調，NCL 並不規定必須從國庫中支出的金額。每一項提款提案仍然需要社群的批准。\n\n如果目前的提案在 250M 至 300M ADA 的範圍內，我很可能會投贊成票。如果提交了這樣的提案，我會支持它，因為它與我認為合理的、基於我已認可的提案的預算相符。\n\n然而，我的決定並非最終決定，可能會根據治理的未來發展而改變。\n\n例如，如果治理行動將多個提案合併導致總成本過高，或者如果 IOG 提案與幾個我不支持的提案或我強烈反對的一個提案（例如 Daedalus 2025 服務增強）捆綁在一起，我可能會重新考慮我的立場。\n\n如果防止不良預算結果的唯一方法是投票支持較低的 NCL，我準備這樣做。這個決定是微妙的，不能簡單地用黑白來看待。\n\n我想避免出現批准較低 NCL 不可避免地導致另一次 GA 提交的情況。反覆處理 NCL 問題既耗時又沒有成效。\n\nDReps 需要優先處理預算提案。如果最終資助的是預算內低質量的項目，那麼較高的 NCL 沒有任何意義。\n\n我的 DRep ID：\ndrep1km69g7ksf8t5g0h9d9tkrcd2tezxelx0wtr76rv2mrkl5nzd6v3",

          "originalText": "I voted NO ⛔️to reduce the Net Change Limit (NCL) to 200M ADA, which has been one of the toughest governance decisions so far. \n\nIt feels like there’s no entirely good option here.\n\nMoreover, I myself called for a lower NCL.\n\nThe current NCL of 350M ADA has some notable drawbacks.\n\nIf high selling pressure causes ADA’s price to drop significantly, say to 0.2 USD, it could result in serious challenges. \n\nFunding the ecosystem in dollar terms would require selling a large amount of ADA from the treasury, leading to a spiral of selling pressure that could worsen the situation.\n\nCardano Whale (@cardano_whale) pointed out that some projects like Tezos and Polkadot have invested heavily in their ecosystems, possess innovative technologies, yet struggle to gain substantial attention.\n\nI fully agree with that.\n\nFor blockchains, maintaining a presence in the top 10 market capitalization rankings is vital.\n\nRetail investors, institutions, and crypto enthusiasts evaluate projects not only based on technology but also on market performance. \n\nIf Cardano drops out of the top 10 for an extended period, it may never regain its position, regardless of decentralization or technological progress like Ouroboros Leios. \n\nThis is an important factor to consider, even if it feels unfair or subjective.\n\nOn the other hand, reducing the NCL to 200M ADA comes with its own set of concerns.\n\nCardano needs investments to advance its technology, support builders, and develop the ecosystem. Without increased user activity, Treasury revenue won't grow. \n\nSpending on maintenance and development in the next years risks exhausting the reserve, ultimately making Cardano economically unsustainable.\n\nProtocol security also hinges on attractive staking rewards and incentives. Moreover, Ouroboros Leios’s potential will remain untapped without active developers, tools, and a growing DeFi ecosystem. Investments in all these areas are crucial.\n\nIOG has made their funding requirements clear: Core Dev needs 96M ADA, Catalyst 69M ADA, and Research 27M ADA. Combined, this totals 192M ADA. The offer from IOG is simple: either approve this funding or let it be.\n\nDebates around fairness, IOG and Charles’s past contributions, and the definition of “completion” for Cardano have their place, but the reality is that IOG holds unmatched expertise in the protocol. No other entity can effectively take over maintenance, development, and research at the same pace or quality.\n\nIf DReps allocate 192M ADA to IOG, only 8M ADA remains for other projects.\n\nAfter reviewing budget proposals, I supported only the essentials I believe the ecosystem absolutely needs: projects like Midgard, Starstream, Hydra, ZK Rollups, Blockfrost, Lucid, Chainlink integration, and others. \n\nFor the CORE category alone, this amounts to around 12M ADA. Across all categories, my total approved budget comes to 213M ADA.\n\nGiven my own estimate of required expenditures is 213M ADA, I cannot support an NCL of 200M ADA. \n\nIt would contradict my stance on necessary project funding versus the cap I approve. This inconsistency guided my decision to vote NO on reducing the NCL.\n\nCardano requires effective marketing and improved governance support, as the current situation is far from ideal.\n\nInvesting in the ecosystem and advancing new technologies must go hand in hand to ensure sustainable growth.\n\nApproving the NCL of 200M ADA, in my view, would mean preserving the status quo, leaving all key responsibilities to IOG while neglecting investment in the broader ecosystem. \n\nEssentially, it would restrict funding for entities that are vital to the ecosystem, just as IOG is.\n\nAn important consideration is the expected scenarios surrounding the NCL.\n\nBoth NCLs, an NCL of 350M ADA and 200M ADA, are extremes in my view.\n\nThe current NCL, set at 350M ADA, has strong support with 76% of the voting stake participating. Nearly the entire voting stake approved it. Drastically reducing the NCL from 350M to 200M ADA would be either irresponsible or overly ambitious.\n\nWhat would happen next? Builders, Intersect, IOG, or others would likely submit a new governance action proposing an intermediate NCL, perhaps 250M or 300M ADA. Alternatively, multiple proposals could be submitted simultaneously.\n\nThis scenario would create an unstable environment that is counterproductive and difficult to support. Such instability undermines progress.\n\nMoreover, the crypto community has little interest in prolonged debates about how much the Cardano ecosystem can afford to invest.\n\nIn an unstable environment, even proposing a coherent budget becomes nearly impossible.\n\nCurrently, we have an NCL of 350M ADA. Consider this likely scenario:\n\nIntersect is expected to submit a governance action for the budget expiring in June. Meanwhile, if a new NCL of 200M ADA is approved by the end of May, the proposed budget would effectively become unconstitutional unless it is approved before the new NCL takes effect. \n\nThis complicates the process and further highlights the issues with sudden, extreme changes.\n\nDebating the NCL through governance actions is both inefficient and overly time-consuming.\n\nIt seems likely that the community's consensus would fall somewhere between 250M–300M ADA. However, no off-chain temperature check was conducted (to which the majority of the community would respond) before the on-chain vote, which led to the current NCL being approved simply to allow the budgeting process to continue.\n\nThe concept of the NCL itself is starting to feel unnecessary, as it constantly shifts based on the majority vote. If the voting stake agrees to increase or decrease the NCL, it will inevitably happen.\n\nIt’s important to emphasize that the NCL doesn’t dictate the amount that must be spent from the treasury. Every withdrawal proposal still requires approval from the community.\n\nI would likely vote YES if the current proposal fell within the 250M–300M ADA range. If a proposal like this is submitted, I would support it, as it aligns with the budget I consider reasonable based on the proposals I have endorsed.\n\nHowever, my decision isn’t final and may change depending on future developments in governance. \n\nFor instance, if governance actions combine multiple proposals that result in an excessively high total cost, or if the IOG proposal is grouped with several proposals I don’t support, or one I strongly oppose, such as the Daedalus 2025 Service Enhancement, I might reconsider my stance.\n\nIf the only way to prevent a poor budget outcome is to vote for a lower NCL, I am prepared to do so. This decision is nuanced and cannot be seen in black-and-white terms.\n\nI want to avoid a scenario where approving a lower NCL inevitably results in another GA submission. Addressing the NCL repeatedly is time-consuming and unproductive. \n\nDReps need to prioritize budget proposals instead.\n\nA higher NCL serves no purpose if it ends up funding low-quality projects within the budget.\n\nMy DRep ID:\ndrep1km69g7ksf8t5g0h9d9tkrcd2tezxelx0wtr76rv2mrkl5nzd6v3"

Setting the NCL at 200M ADA would nearly exhaust the limit, leaving little room for funding other critical infrastructure proposals. This situation risks hindering Cardano’s growth.\n\nFundamentally, the NCL is not a budget intended to be fully spent, but rather a guardrail that defines the maximum amount that may be withdrawn within a given period. As we are still in the early stages of transitioning to on-chain governance, imposing a restrictive cap at this time could undermine the flexibility needed for effective decision-making and timely response.\n\nMoreover, the NCL is not fixed permanently once established. It should be subject to review and adjustment as budget execution progresses and as market conditions evolve.\n\nIn this transitional period, it is prudent to design with sufficient margin to accommodate uncertainty. Doing so will support sustainable and strategic ecosystem governance.\n\n#Cardano #ADA #Drep"

It’s based on a 2024 treasury income model (approx. 336M ADA) and now serves as the foundation for current budget deliberations.\n\n❌ Rejected: A more conservative proposal to cap 2025 at 300M ADA and 2026 at 250M ADA was not approved.\n\n🟠 Under Review:\n“2025 Cardano NCL” proposes lowering the NCL to 200M ADA, urging a cautious approach during this first year of decentralized treasury governance.\n“300M ADA for Epochs 563–635” aims to establish an NCL for early 2026, supporting budget continuity across overlapping periods.\n\nMeanwhile, several new funding proposals have been submitted:\n\n1⃣ 7.5M ADA for Community Builder Proposals — includes only those with ≥2.69B ADA support, excluding proposals from Intersect and founding entities.\n\n2⃣ 1.5M ADA for Amaru Rust Node Development — a PRAGMA-led initiative to diversify Cardano nodes and enhance network resilience.\n\n3⃣ 50M ADA for DeFi Liquidity — aims to seed liquidity into DEXs and stablecoins, with yield partially returned to the treasury.\n\nAs SIPO DRep, we’re evaluating these developments based on:\n\n🔍 Cautious governance: supports the 200M ADA NCL.\n🚀 Growth & momentum: supports maintaining the 350M ADA cap.\n⚖️ Balanced compromise: 300M ADA could be a pragmatic middle ground.\n\nFor funding proposals, our assessment will focus on:\nDoes it generate a return to the treasury?\nIs transparency and execution capacity ensured?\nDoes it set a strong precedent for the first year of decentralized financial governance?\n\nThe NCL is more than just a number — it reflects Cardano’s financial philosophy and growth trajectory. Changing the cap directly impacts which proposals are viable.\n\nWe’ll soon publish SIPO’s evaluation criteria and vote logic for each major proposal. In the meantime, we welcome your input before the voting begins.\n\nIf you support our work as a DRep, please consider delegating:\n\nDRep ID:\ndrep1yffld2866p00cyg3ejjdewtvazgah7jjgk0s9m7m5ytmmdq33v3zh\n\nFor Daedalus:\ndrep120m237kstm7pzywv5nwtjm8gj8dl55j9nupwlkapz77mgv7zu7l"

          "text": "🚫我對由 Intersect 管理的 2.75 億 ADA 的 Cardano 區塊鏈生態系統預算投了反對票。\n\n理由：\n\n我強烈反對將所有提案捆綁在一個包裡供 DReps 批准。\n\n關鍵提案與不太重要或不必要的提案混雜在一起，其中許多屬於 Catalyst。\n\n預算責任要求對單個提案或較小的提案包做出決策，而不是一個大的提案包。\n\n提案細目：\n\n• 在 Ekklesia，我對總額為 2.133 億 ADA 的 35 個提案投了贊成票——這比 Ekklesia 中 DRep 集體批准的預算低了 6200 萬 ADA。\n\n• 我支持的六個提案有一個單獨的 GA——這些是頂級項目，大多數 DReps 都認為會對生態系統產生積極影響。\n\n• Intersect 的 GA 包括我想支持的 19 個提案，總額為 2.042 億 ADA，其中包括四個 IOG 项目，合併預算為 1.94 億 ADA。\n\n• 同時，總額為 6550 萬 ADA 的 14 個提案是我在 Ekklesia 中不支持的提案。\n\n假設 IOG 能夠為其提案提交自己的 GA，我指的是支持總預算為 1000 萬 ADA 的 15 個提案。\n\n與此相對的是預算為 6550 萬 ADA 的 14 個我不想支持的提案。\n\n作為一名 DRep，我無法接受。\n\n就我而言，這種不平衡使得捆綁方式不可接受。我相信許多 DReps 也會為此苦惱。\n\n首選替代方案：\n\n我敦促團隊提交自己的 GA 或要求 Intersect 按類別或門檻來組織提案。\n\n• 對單個提案進行鏈上投票是理想的，儘管 GA 提交需要 10 萬 ADA 的保證金對許多項目來說是一個挑戰。\n\n• 更小、更集中的 GA 提案包將有助於更好的決策。\n\n淨變化限額 (NCL) 擔憂：\n\n目前的 NCL 不明確，使得批准 2.75 億 ADA 的預算為時過早。目前有兩項關於 NCL 的有效 GA：\n\n1. 2 億 ADA NCL，將於 2025 年 5 月 29 日到期。\n2. 3 億 ADA NCL，將於 2025 年 6 月 8 日到期。\n\n現有的 NCL 獲得了強而有力的支持，但許多 DReps 可能僅僅是為了維持預算流程的進行而支持它，並非因為他們贊成高限額。\n\n在 DReps 就 NCL 達成一致之前，批准如此龐大的預算意義不大。\n\n此 GA 將於 2025 年 6 月 13 日到期。如果兩項有效的 NCL GA 都失敗，確認了目前的 NCL，我仍將有一個 epoch 的時間來重新考慮我的投票。\n\n後續步驟及我的立場：\n\n我敦促 DReps 盡快就 NCL GA 進行投票。\n\n我仍然認為，維持預算責任的最佳方式是對單個提案進行投票，而不是依賴 NCL。讓我們在鏈上處理這個問題。\n\n我投反對票是向 Intersect 發出訊號，表明我支持流程變更。我不想批准一個價值 2.75 億 ADA 的大型提案包——我更喜歡單個投票或較小的提案包。\n\n然而，我對在 Ekklesia 中投贊成票的項目的支持仍然堅定。如果他們提交自己的 GA，我會投贊成票。\n\n只要是通過適當的 GA 提交，我也願意重新考慮所有提案。\n\n最終，我認為理想的 NCL 應該在 2.5 億 ADA 左右，並保留 1000 萬 ADA 作為應急儲備。\n\n平衡貨幣政策保護和生態系統投資是一項挑戰——我們必須在資助增長的同時盡量減少拋售壓力。\n\n解決方案是確保只有具有積極長期影響的項目才能從國庫獲得 ADA。\n\n在我看來，目前提案包中的一些提案是不必要的。\n\n我的 DRep ID：\ndrep1km69g7ksf8t5g0h9d9tkrcd2tezxelx0wtr76rv2mrkl5nzd6v3",

          "originalText": "🚫I voted NO on the Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Budget of 275M ADA, administered by Intersect.\n\nRationale:\n\nI strongly oppose bundling all proposals into a single bundle for DReps to approve.\n\nCritical proposals are grouped with less important or unnecessary ones, many of which belong to Catalyst.\n\nBudget responsibility requires making decisions on individual proposals or smaller bundles, not one large one.\n\nProposal Breakdown:\n\n• In Ekklesia, I voted YES for 35 proposals totaling 213.3M ADA—which is 62M ADA lower than the collective DRep-approved budget in Ekklesia.\n\n• A separate GA exists for six of the proposals I supported—these are top-tier projects that most DReps agree will positively impact the ecosystem.\n\n• Intersect’s GA includes 19 proposals I want to support, totaling 204.2M ADA, including four IOG projects with a combined budget of 194M ADA.\n\n• At the same time, 14 proposals totaling 65.5M ADA were proposals I did not support in Ekklesia.\n\nAssuming that IOG is able to submit its own GA for their proposals, I am talking about supporting 15 proposals with a total budget of 10M ADA that I want to support. \n\nAgainst this are 14 proposals with a budget of 65.5M ADA that I do not want to support.\n\nAs a DRep, I cannot accept it.\n\nIn my case, this imbalance makes the bundled approach unacceptable. I believe that many DReps will struggle with this as well.\n\nPreferred Alternative:\n\nI urge teams to submit their own GAs or ask Intersect to structure proposals by category or threshold.\n\n• On-chain voting for individual proposals would be ideal, though the 100K ADA deposit for GA submissions is a challenge for many projects.\n\n• Smaller, more focused GA bundles would allow better decision-making.\n\nNet Change Limit (NCL) Concerns:\n\nThe current NCL is unclear, making a 275M ADA budget approval premature. There are two active GAs regarding NCL:\n\n1. 200M ADA NCL that expires May 29, 2025.\n2. 300M ADA NCL that expires June 8, 2025.\n\nThe existing NCL received strong support, but many DReps may have backed it simply to keep the budget process moving, not because they favored a high limit.\n\nUntil DReps align on the NCL, approving such a large budget makes little sense.\n\nThis GA expires June 13, 2025. If both active NCL GAs fail, confirming the current NCL, I will still have one epoch to reconsider my vote.\n\nNext Steps & My Position:\n\nI urge DReps to vote on the NCL GAs as soon as possible.\n\nI continue to believe that budgetary responsibility is best maintained by voting on individual proposals rather than relying on an NCL. Let’s handle this on-chain.\n\nMy NO vote is a signal to Intersect that I support a process change. I do not want to approve one large bundle worth 275M ADA—I prefer individual votes or smaller proposal bundles.\n\nHowever, my support for the projects I voted YES in Ekklesia remains firm. I will vote YES if they submit their own GA.\n\nI am also open to reconsidering all proposals, as long as they come through proper GA submissions.\n\nUltimately, I believe the ideal NCL should be around 250M ADA, with 10M ADA kept as a reserve for emergencies.\n\nBalancing monetary policy protection and ecosystem investment is a challenge—we must minimize selling pressure while funding growth.\n\nThe solution is ensuring that only projects with a positive long-term impact receive ADA from the Treasury.\n\nIn my view, some proposals in the current bundle are unnecessary.\n\nMy DRep ID:\ndrep1km69g7ksf8t5g0h9d9tkrcd2tezxelx0wtr76rv2mrkl5nzd6v3"

          "text": "投票 ❌：Cardano 區塊鏈生態系統預算 - 由 Intersect 管理的 2.75 億 ADA\n\n===================\n如果您不同意我的反對票，請重新委託給另一位 DRep。如果您重新委託給投贊成票的 DRep，則將計為贊成票。\n===================\n\n理由\n我投票反對擬議的 2025 年 Cardano 區塊鏈生態系統預算，因為我認為申請的總金額過高，特別是對於最低可行性鏈上治理的第一年而言。\n\n我還認為，將 39 個提案捆綁在一起進行一次投票，限制了 DReps 表達我們在早期階段所看到的差異化支持的能力。這種方法削弱了細微差別，並對各種不同的資金優先事項強加了全有或全無的決定。\n\n我還承認存在三個創始實體，它們被分配了 Genesis ADA，並正在以不同程度的成功努力根據其最初的使命改進 Cardano。其中一些使命名義上已經完成，一些使命以其原始形式繼續，一些則以新的形式繼續。我不敢說了解所有的細微差別。\n\n儘管如此，我還是將其作為我決策的一個因素。國庫資金的使用應審慎，並與這些實體的存在相輔相成並加以考慮。\n\n這次對整個預算投反對票是基於：\n\n1. 我參與 DRep 投票階段以及 DRep 整體參與的程度；\n2. 一些提案相對於其他提案獲得的支持程度；\n3. 某些提案相對於其他提案的相對重要性，以及團隊的質量及其對 Cardano 使命的奉獻精神；\n4. 以及 Catalyst 很可能（在本次或未來的預算提案中）獲得足夠支持以繼續支持小型、實驗性或商業項目的期望。\n\n雖然從國庫支出並非新鮮事（Catalyst 以前就這樣做過），但這是第一個主要的年度鏈上預算，它開創了一個先例。\n\n在我看來，問題不在於 Cardano 經濟體內部的通貨膨脹——大多數 ADA 不會用於購買 NFTs 或 FTs。也不僅僅是略高的通貨緊縮率。更深層次的問題是由於外部拋售壓力導致的 ADA 貶值。大部分受資助的 ADA 將兌換成法定貨幣（USD、EUR 等），而不是在內部循環。這給 ADA 的價格增加了下行壓力。\n\n這是一個有其特殊性的蹺蹺板。\n\n在現實世界經濟中，如果你為了「啟動」經濟而增加支出，如果服務和商品的供應無法滿足需求，就會面臨通貨膨脹。\n\n在一個仍處於萌芽階段的區塊鏈經濟中，增加支出基本上意味著將原生代幣兌換成法定貨幣，結果就是貶值。我們不是直接用 ADA 交換 Cardano 經濟商品和服務，而是將其出售到現實世界。ADA 沒有在內部循環。這給 ADA 的價格增加了下行壓力。\n\n這種貶值影響到每一個人：\n\n1. 最重要的受資助項目\n2. 未受資助的項目\n3. 未申請資助的建設者\n4. 通過機會成本資助所有這一切的 ADA 持有者\n\n當然，這是不可避免的。大部分分配的 ADA 很可能會被兌換成法定貨幣（USD、EUR 等）以支付服務費用，而不會在生態系統內保留或再利用。這造成了匯率壓力，削弱了 ADA 的價值。\n\n問題不在於是否會發生貶值——它會的。真正的問題是：我們的底線在哪裡？這個預算中的所有 39 個提案所帶來的價值是否大於它們共同造成的貶值成本？我們需要將它們全部捆綁在一次贊成/反對的預算投票中嗎？我認為不需要。\n\n我們正在批准一項龐大的、以外部為重點的預算，而此時 Cardano 的「區塊鏈經濟」和治理機制仍不成熟且內部脆弱。\n\n國庫資金應主要集中於不同形式的關鍵公共產品。特別是如果它們是開源的；支持基礎設施、研究、工具，甚至教育、推廣 Cardano。這適用於當這些產品符合 Cardano 作為公共基礎設施的長期使命時。是的，可能會出現例外情況，但這些例外情況代價高昂——而且其他人會為此買單。\n\n如果我們過度資助影響力較小的提案，我們就有可能僅僅通過稀釋其支付價值來削弱最關鍵提案的影响力。\n\n因此，我認為一個更小、分階段、嚴格關注基礎公共產品的預算將是一個更好、更安全的起點。\n\n我將此理由作為對擬議預算行動的認真看法，旨在通過鼓勵提交者 (Intersect) 考慮更多因素來為該過程做出貢獻。",

          "originalText": "VOTE ❌: Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Budget - 275M ada Administered by Intersect \n\n===================\nPlease redelegate to another DRep, if you disagree with my NO vote. If you redelegate to a YES voting DRep, it will count as a YES. \n===================\n\nRATIONALE\nI am voting NO on the proposed 2025 Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Budget because I believe the total amount requested is too high, especially  for the first year of minimum viable on-chain governance. \n\nI also believe that bundling 39 proposals together into a single vote limits DReps’ ability to express the differentiated support that we saw in earlier stages. This approach flattens nuance and imposes an all-or-nothing decision on a diverse set of funding priorities.\n\nI also acknowledge the existence of the three founding entities that were allocated Genesis ADA that are working with different levels of success to improve Cardano according to their original missions. Some of these missions have been nominally completed, some of these missions continue in their original form, some continue in a new form. I do not pretend to know all the nuances. \n\nStill I take that as a factor in my decision-making. Treasury funds should be used judiciously in complement and in awareness of the existence of the entities. \n\nThis vote against this Budget in its full size is based on:\n\n1. My participation in the DRep voting stage and the level of DRep participation as a whole;\n2. The level of support that some proposals received relative to others;\n3. The relative importance of certain proposals vs others and the quality of the teams and their dedication to Cardano’s mission;\n4. And the expectation that Catalyst will likely gain sufficient support (in this or future budget proposals) to continue to support smaller, experimental, or commercial projects.\n\nWhile spending from the Treasury is not new (Catalyst has done it before), this is the first major annual on-chain budget, and it sets a precedent.\n\nIn my view, the issue is not inflation within the Cardano economy — most ADA will not be used to buy NFTs or FTs. Nor is it simply about a slightly higher disinflation rate. The deeper issue is ADA devaluation due to external sell pressure. Most of the funded ADA will be exchanged for fiat (USD, EUR, etc.), not recycled internally. This adds downward pressure on ADA’s price.\n\nIt is a see-saw that has its quirks. \n\nIn a real-world economy, if you spend more to \"jumpstart\" the economy, face inflation if the supply of services and goods cannot meet demand. \n\nIn a still nascent blockchain economy, spending more essentially means converting the native token for fiat, and the result is devaluation. We are not exchanging ADA directly for Cardano economy goods and services, we are selling it into the real world. The ADA is not recycled internally. This adds downward pressure on ADA’s price.\n\nThis devaluation affects everyone:\n\n1. The most important funded projects\n2. The projects that were not funded\n3. The builders who didn’t ask for funding \n4. The ADA holders who fund all of it through opportunity cost\n\nOf course, that is unavoidable. Most of the ADA allocated will likely be converted to fiat (USD, EUR, etc.) to pay for services, not retained or reused within the ecosystem. This creates exchange rate pressure, weakening ADA’s value.\n\nThe question isn’t whether devaluation will occur — it will. The real question is: Where do we draw the line? Do all 39 proposals in this budget bring more value than the cost of the devaluation they collectively impose? Do we need to bundle them all in one YES/NO budget vote? I think No. \n\nWe are approving a large, externally-focused budget at a time when Cardano’s “blockchain economy” and governance mechanism is still immature and internally fragile.\n\nTreasury funds should primarily be focused on critical public goods in different forms. Especially if they are open source; support infrastructure, research, tools, even education, promotion of Cardano. This applies when the goods align with the long-term mission of Cardano as public infrastructure. Yes, there may be exceptions that emerge, but those exceptions are expensive — and others will pay for them.\n\nIf we overfund less impactful proposals, we risk undermining the impact of the most critical ones, simply by diluting the value of what they are paid in.\n\nFor this reason, I believe a smaller, phased budget focused tightly on foundational public goods would be a better and safer starting point.\n\nI include this rationale as an earnest view of the proposed budget action with the aim of contributing to the process by encouraging the submitter (Intersect) to take more factors into account."
