      "paragraph1": "The rise of AI will propel humanity as a whole to new heights in intelligence and productivity, but it won't take responsibility for every individual. Those who can't keep up with AI's pace will be left far behind. Faced with this unprecedented force of change, human nature and social inertia make a smooth transition unlikely—more likely, we'll be plunged into an era of chaos.",
      "paragraph2": "Rather than placing all our hopes on governments and corporations, we prefer to keep our opportunities in our own hands.",
