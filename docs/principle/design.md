A mobile-first Cardano governance app UI inspired by Twitter (X),
clean, minimalist, and text-centric design,
timeline-based information flow centered around governance proposals and community discussions,
proposal list displayed as lightweight cards,
each proposal card presents a clear title and a short abstraction (summary),
card design is flat and restrained, with subtle background contrast instead of heavy borders or shadows,
consistent vertical rhythm and spacing between cards,
high information density with strong typographic hierarchy,
proposal title emphasized with larger, bolder text,
abstraction shown as secondary text optimized for quick scanning,
large, readable typography suitable for long-form governance content,
subtle dividers and soft separators to maintain reading flow,
disciplined use of white space to enhance clarity without wasting screen space,
primary color palette in Cardano blue, white, and neutral black/gray tones,
system-style neutral icons and minimal interaction feedback,
modern, rational, and trustworthy visual language,
designed for serious public governance conversations rather than entertainment,
credibility, clarity, and deliberation prioritized over visual excitement,
optimized for fast reading, thoughtful evaluation, and low-friction participation,
Web3-native but intentionally non-flashy,
iOS-style UI with high usability and comfortable one-hand interaction,
content-first, signal-over-noise product philosophy
